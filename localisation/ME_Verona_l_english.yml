 vrn_scaligeri_verona_desc: "In Verona, the Ghibelline faction had by then gained the upper hand, and with Mastino I della Scala the Venetian city passed from commune to lordship in a non-traumatic manner. It was in 1262 that Mastino della Scala was appointed perpetual Captain General of the People, and immediately Mastino tried to ease the civil strife and had the villages devastated by the numerous fights helped. Already the following year the Guelphs made an attempt on his life, but the plot was uncovered even before it could be carried out: the captured conspirators were condemned to death, while those who managed to escape were helped by the Sambonifacio."

 vrn_military_campaign_desc: "As soon as the whole company was assembled, standing in a wide circle round [Root.Monarch.GetName], a curios conversation began. The marshals began to murmur slowly: first one joined and then another, until they were all chanting together in a long rising and falling rhytm, now louder on one side of the ring, now dying away there and rising to a great boom on the other side."

 vrn_trading_venice_title: "Trading in Venice"
 vrn_trading_venice_desc: "The sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was shining brightly. But the light brought little hope to the man from the lagoon. The enemy before them seemed to have grown rather than diminished, and still more were pressing up from the valley through the breach. The sortie upon the canals gained only a brief respite. The assault on the gates was redoubled."
 vrn_conquest_tuscany_title: "Conquest of Tuscany"
 vrn_conquest_tuscany_desc: "There was a beaten way, north-westward along the foot-hills of the White Mountains, aid this they followed, up and down in a green country, crossing small swift streams by many fords.

 vrn_trading_florence_title: "Trading in Florence"
 vrn_trading_florence_desc: "In the St Mary's square the host of our horses roared like a sea, swarmed about its feet from end to end.

Before the Cathedral's door the dead and broken were piled like shingle in a storm; ever higher rose the hideous mounds, and still the enemy came on."

 vrn_ward_save_desc: "The Estensi policy was a tenacious and careful defense of a continuous balance between the neighboring powers: the Republic of Venice, Milan, Mantua and the papal possessions.

 vrn_plains_emilia_title: "Plains of Emilia"
 vrn_plains_emilia_desc: "With astonishing speed and skill they checked their steeds, wheeled, and came charging round. Soon the companions found themselves in a ring of horsemen moving  in a running circle, up the hill-slope behind them and down, round and round them, and drawing ever inwards. Without a word or cry, suddenly, the Riders halted. A thicket of spears were pointed towards the strangers; and some of the horsemen had guns in hand, and their fingers were already fitted to the trigger. The one rode forward, a tall man, taller than all the rest; from his helm as a crest a white horsetail flowed."
 vrn_po_valley_title: "The Po Valley"
 vrn_po_valley_desc: "The day waned, and dusk was twined about the boles of the trees. At last they saw, rising dimly before them, a steep dark land: they had come to the feet of the mountains, and to the green roots of tall Alps. Down the hillside the younglings, leaping from its springs high above, ran noisily from step to step to meet them. One the right of the stream there was a long slope, clad with grass, now grey in the twilight. No trees grew there and it was open to the sky; stars were shining already in lakes between shores of cloud."

 vrn_lombardo_veneto_desc: "It was a deep night. We lay on top of a pile of stone, and could see nothing beyond it. Mist of shadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all round us. The air seemed hot and heavy; and it was full of rustlings, creakings and a murmur like voices passing. Later there was a great rumble of thunder away south, and flashes of lighting far away across the Valley, Every now and then we could see mountain-peaks, miles and miles away, stab out suddenly, black and white, and then vanish. And behind us there were noises like thunder in hills, but different. At times the whole valley echoed."

 vrn_choosing_side_title: "Choosing a Side"
 vrn_choosing_side_desc: "The term Ghibelline continued to indicate attachment to the declining Imperial authority in Italy, and saw a brief resurgence during the Italian campaigns of Emperors Henry VII (1310) and Louis IV (1327). Pope John XXII was under French control through the Avignon Papacy and therefore aligned with the French-allied House of Luxembourg against the German King Louis IV. The Pope accordingly threatened heresy charges against the Ghibellines and excommunicated Louis IV in 1324."
 vrn_final_offense_title: "Final Offense"
 vrn_final_offense_desc: "During the last 500 years we, Italians have tortured ourselves questioning who would be the most fitting guide for us humans while we are on this sacred earth. \nSurely God will be the one guiding us when we live behind our mortal remains, should [PAP.Monarch.GetName] the Vicar of Christ guide us or should we let $EMPERORNAME$. the successor of the emperors of old who ruled upon our lands, do it?"
 vrn_war_lombardy_title: "War in Lombardy"
 vrn_war_lombardy_desc: "As they rode forward the day was overcast. Low grey clouds came over the Wold. A mist shrouded the sun. Ever nearer the tree-clad slopes of the Golenali forest loomed, slowly darkling as the sun went west. They saw no sign of any trail to right or left, but here and there they passed single Lombard, fallen in their tracks as they ran, with grey-feathered arrow sticking in back or throat. At last as the afternoon was waning they came to the eaves of the forest, and in an open glade among the first trees they found the place of the great burning: the ashes were still hot and smoking. War is coming."
 vrn_fall_visconti_title: "Fall of Visconti"
 vrn_fall_visconti_desc: "Beside it was a great pile of helms and mail, cloven shields, and broken swords, bows and darts and other gear of war. Upon a stake in the middle was set a Lombard officer's head; upon its shattered helm the white badge could still be seen. Further away, not far from the river, where it came streaming out from the edge of the wood, there was a mound. It was newly raised: the raw earth was covered with fresh-cut turves: about it were planted fifteen spears. The last vestiges of the Visconti are no more, the remnants of their armies run shattered in the fields outside the cities seeking for salvation from the horse lord of Mantua."

 vrn_stella_forte_desc: "Even as they spoke there came a blare of trumpets. Then there was a crash and a flash and smoke. The waters of the Deeping-stream poured out hissing and foaming: they were choked no longer, a gaping was blasted in the wall. A host of dark shapes poured in."
 vrn_conquest_of_rome_title: "Conquest of Rome"
 vrn_conquest_of_rome_desc: "Founded according to tradition on April 21, 753 BC (although recent excavations in Lapis niger would date the foundation back to 2 centuries earlier), during its three millennia of history it was the first metropolis of humanity, the beating heart of one of the most important ancient civilizations, which influenced society, the culture, language, literature, art, architecture, philosophy, religion, law and customs of the following centuries. Place of origin of the Latin language, it was the capital of the Roman Empire which extended its dominion over the whole Mediterranean basin and most of Europe, the Papal States, subjected to the temporal power of the popes and the future Kingdom of Italy. By definition, Rome, Caput Mundi and Eternal City are defined. Its historic center, delimited by the perimeter of the Aurelian walls, overlapping of testimonies of almost three millennia, is an expression of the historical, artistic and cultural heritage of the western European world."

 vrn_santa_maria_antica_desc: "The building was erected to serve as a place of prayer for a female monastery, founded between 744 and 745 by two sisters of Germanic origin, Auctonda and Natalia, and adjacent to the Curtis Regia of the Lombard kingdom. Not much is known of this first building, but a portion of a ciborium reused in the masonry and a fragment of a black and white mosaic floor have survived. A couple of centuries later, in 929, Pope John X entrusted the abbey of Santa Maria in Organo with the jurisdiction over the small church, already known as 'Antiqua'. Thus, in 1024, Inghelperto, abbot of Santa Maria in Organo, installed fifteen clerics in Santa Maria Antica, officially ending the women's monastery. n the 12th century it was rebuilt in Romanesque style following the catastrophic earthquake of 1117, which devastated Verona and irreparably damaged the Lombard church. The reconstruction work was quite rapid and was completed two or three decades before the consecration, which took place on 11 November 1185 by the Patriarch of Aquileia Gotifredo."
 vrn_casa_mercanti_title: "Casa dei Mercanti"

 vrn_great_patrons_desc: "The Este court in Ferrara was one of the most vital in northern Italy since the end of the fourteenth century, when Niccolò d'Este started the University and began construction of the castle.

 vrn_domus_mercatorum: "Domus Mercatorum"
 desc_vrn_domus_mercatorum: "In 1210 it was built in wood to house the merchant associations and it was only in 1301 that Alberto I della Scala, shortly before his death, had its masonry construction begun, with the main objective of making it the place where wool was traded. Over the centuries it underwent numerous transformations until, finally, an attempt was made to restore its original appearance: today the palace has a portico supported by columns and pillars and a façade with mullioned windows and battlements."
 vrn_rinascimento_scaligeri: "Rinascimento degli Scaligeri"
 desc_vrn_rinascimento_scaligeri: "A short walk along the Adige River and we head towards Castelvecchio, at the beginning of Corso Cavour. Along this road axis, the ancient Via Postumia, the families of the Veronese nobility built their splendid residences. The first palace we come across is Palazzo Canossa. This is a Renaissance building, but it already has signs of Mannerism, the current that was established between the Renaissance and the Baroque."
 vrn_chiesa_santa_maria_antica: "Chiesa di Santa Maria Antica"
 desc_vrn_chiesa_santa_maria_antica: "The church is enclosed by several buildings, so that the Romanesque gabled façade, with a central portal and splayed single lancet windows at the sides, is barely visible. The northern side, on the other hand, is more exposed; like the façade and the bell tower, it has the characteristic wall face of Veronese Romanesque architecture, with alternating courses of tuff ashlars and brickwork. The side elevation, moreover, is divided into two superimposed orders corresponding to the internal subdivision into minor side aisles and major nave, both crowned by an eaves cornice in stone; along the lower order there are some splayed single-lancet windows and the side entrance portal, surmounted by the monumental ark of Cangrande I della Scala. The sarcophagus of the Veronese lord is situated within a trefoil arch and its roof is surmounted by an equestrian statue of the prince, a work attributed to Giovanni di Rigino and considered a masterpiece of the 14th century. The square bell tower is set on the main apse and closed at the top by a belfry with double lancet windows divided by small columns characterised by trapezoidal capitals surmounted by abacuses; the belfry is in turn surmounted by a conical terracotta roof and four pinnacles at the corners."
 vrn_epoca_scaligera: "Epoca Scaligera"
 desc_vrn_epoca_scaligera: "The wall is formed by curtains and towers, defended by a deep moat dug into the tuff hill. The material excavated here was also used to build the wall, with the same thickness and height. The Scaligera wall, near the fourteenth tower, continued to deviate south-east towards the overhang of the hill, where it ended. In 1520, the arched archway was opened in this section, at the same time as the construction of the modern curtain wall directed towards the Rondella di Santa Toscana. The Scaliger curtain wall from the fourteenth tower continued northwards along the crest of the hill, reaching Castel San Felice, to which it connects after the fifth tower. The internal road allowed the defenders to move along the walls. The towers (with the exception of the fourteenth) were modified by the nineteenth-century restoration, as were the first to the fourth. At the height of the curtain walls, each tower is connected to the walkway, but in addition, compared to the first section, a section of the walkway on both sides has been ordered with loopholes for marksmen, eliminating the crenellated crowning."
