# Events:
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME1: "Fall of the Timurid Empire"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC1: "As the days dutifully pass by, what remains of the Timurid Empire crumbles deeper down into disparity. Scorched earth, ravaged by war, subsides into the annals of history, stepping back to the shadows, for one day a new empire shall rise and take its place, repeating the merciless cycle Timur himself once took part in. Betrayed by ambitious relatives, manipulated by greedy nobles, and led astray by his own ignorance, $MONARCH$'s decrepit empire meets its match at last. The future remains uncertain for Persia."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event1.EVTOPTA1: "What shall happen of our realm?"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME2: "Fall of Herat"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC2: "As the days grew innumerable, the parched and hunger-stricken forces of Herat began to lose their last flicker of hope. Famine plagued men in likeness to disease, both ravaging each street they galloped throughout the city. The stricken people of the Pearl of Khorasan were under unbearable stress as the weight of heaven itself began pushing down on their shoulders, just as hell rose up to greet their sodden corpses. Surrender was imminent, and the gates of Herat opened to be greeted by an equally tumultuous fate. What once was considered Shah Rukh's golden jewel in the deserts of Persia is now reduced to the ashes and cinder of lost hope, shattered dreams, and a dead city."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event2.EVTOPTA1: "See the empire in flame; try to save it in vain."
 ME_TIMURID_EMPIRE_HAS_FALLEN.tooltip: "§YThe Timurid Empire will be split amongst its relatives.§!"
 ME_ALLOW_POWER_STRUGLE.tooltip: "§YAllows power struggle over the Timurid Empire mechanic.§!"
 Timurid_prince_power_strugle_title: "The Power Struggle"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME3: "Ulugh Beg - The Pride of Samarkand"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC3: "Atop the rich throne of Transoxiana sits grandson of Tamerlane, Ulugh Beg himself. Among the princes of the Timurid Empire, Beg was in perhaps the best position in 1444. He exerted considerable influence over the Silk Road, controlling one of its main stops: Samarkand. The only true danger to Transoxiana was the Uzbek Horde, which launched dozens of border raids of the years. The Chagatai sit to the east, weakened and ripe for the taking. To our west, the Khorasani wait patiently for the death of Shah Rukh, though hardly in a state to begin their conquests. Ulugh Beg is the only prince in a truly favorable position, which he will undoubtedly use to his advantage."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event3.EVTOPTA1: "Ok"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME4: "babur bin Baysunkur - The Combatant of Khorasan"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC4: "Babur bin Baysunkur, also known as Abul-Qasim Babur Mirza, was perhaps the greatest strategist of the Timurid brothers. Though his holdings were relatively small, he would move on to defeat the Transoxianians in combat, nearly restoring the Timurid Empire to its height under Shah Rukh. Khorasan sits in a somehwat troubling position: a handful of Persian nations to the west offer promising expansion, but if we cannot deal with Ulugh Beg, he will surely spell our downfall."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event4.EVTOPTA1: "Very well"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME5: "Malik Mahmud - Ruler of Sistan"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC5: "Malik Mahmud sits upon a crumbling throne. Not a Timurid himself, he receives no special care at the hands of Shah Rukh. He is not a prince of the empire, but merely a vassal, forced to serve. The situation does not appear favorable, but anything can happen in the heat of battle."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME6: "Heir of the Shah?"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC6: "Ulugh Beg, born of Shah Rukh, remains the last truly legitimate successor to the Timurid Empire. Alongside the collapse of Rukh's empire was a power vacuum, which we succesfully filled with our own image of greatness. The time has come to proclaim ourselves the next Timurid Empire and continue the task of Tamerlane."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event6.EVTOPTA1: "I am the Empire!"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event6.EVTOPTA2: "Family first, brother."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME7: "Ulugh Beg has Seized the Empire"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC7: "A brutal campaign of blood and carnage has left Herat crumbling to fire and brimstone. Ulugh Beg's troubling campaign against the empire leaves us with no choice but to retaliate. Such unjust brutality against one's own people cannot be tolerated. We must take the lead and throw off Ulugh Beg!"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event7.EVTOPTA1: "The time has come. We march on Samarkand!"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event7.EVTOPTA2: "It's risky to fight him right now."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME9: "Abu Sa'id Mirza"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC9: "Abu Sa'id Mirza is the second son of Muhammad Mirza, who in turn was one of the grandchildren of Timur. He only recently has arrived in our court wishing to become one of servant for [Root.Monarch.GetName]. He does not have much experience, however he shows much promise in his actions."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event9.EVTOPTA1: "We shall accept him to the court."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event9.EVTOPTA2: "We shall not trust such a man in our side."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME10: "Mirza Asks for Promotion"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC10: "Mirza has proven himself time and time again through resolve and cunning. He has served well in the court, but now he demands more. He wishes to lead our armies into battle. This arrangement would be beneficial, but how high can we allow him to work to?"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event10.EVTOPTA1: "We shall promote him."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event10.EVTOPTA2: "We only promote capable men."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME11: "Death of Ulugh Beg"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC11: "Just like Shah Rukh perished decades ago, so did the benevolent Ulugh Beg, leaving the state in temporary turmoil. A great scholar, he helped push the scientific fields further, while also ruling his domain. For his great deeds, he was consequently nicknamed 'Ulugh Beg' which means 'Great Ruler'."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event11.EVTOPTA1: "We mourn this loss."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event11.EVTOPTA2: "Abu Sa'id shall lead us from now on."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME12: "A Possible Traitor?"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC12: "Abu Sa'id, although capable, has shown himself as a challenge to our throne. Gaining supporters for within our court, he threatens our position. How shall we deal with him?"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event12.EVTOPTA1: "He is too influential in our court. He must be 'purified'."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event12.EVTOPTA2: "He does not have the power to challenge me."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME13: "Baysonqor's Rebellion"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC13: "The Government of Qom has launched a campaign against us! We never should have trusted the conniving prince. We can only hope to hasten our preparations for defense."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event13.EVTOPTA1: "We do not have the men to protect our Farsi lands."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event13.EVTOPTA2: "The war is not over, not under my rule!"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event13.EVTOPTA3: "Let him think he's free; we shall strike later."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME15: "Connections Within the Empire"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC15: "Your current §BTimurid Legitimacy§! is [Root.timurid_legitimacy_value.GetValue]."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event15.EVTOPT1: "Use my connections to recruit more troops."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event15.EVTOPT2: "A general, loyal to me, would serve me best."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event15.EVTOPT3: "I must keep the people happy."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event15.EVTOPT4: "I should use my legitimacy for more money."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event15.EVTOPT5: "A military advisor should do for now."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event15.EVTOPT6: "I've changed my mind."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME16: "[TIM.Monarch.GetName] Demands Subjugation"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC16: "The pretender to Tamerlane's Legacy has sent a scathingly disrespectful letter by messenger to the palac4e of $CAPITAL$. He demands our complete servitude. Despite the obvious lack of respect, we promises to ensure our territorial gain and mutual benefit. How should we respond?"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event16.EVTOPT1: "We shall accept his demands."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event16.EVTOPT2: "Bring it on, pretender scum!"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME19: "The Beijing-Samarkand Pact"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC19: "The Chinese offer us a chance at partition. Should we accept, we would expect minor territorial gain as well as security from Chinese border raids. However, there lies a stipulation..."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event19.EVTOPT1: "We shall accept this offer."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event19.EVTOPT2: "Never!"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME20: "Stampeding the Traitor"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC20: "Baysonqor lies weakened by war and riddled with disease. Now may be the time to strike, lest our opportunity pass us by."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event20.EVTOPT1: "The traitor's reign shall end now!"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event20.EVTOPT2: "A bold move, I shall be more careful with this plan."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME21: "A Successful Stampede"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC21: "The westward revolting prince of Qom has, at last, been quelled amidst our overwhelming show of force. Through strength comes unity, and thus the descendants of Tamerlane shall be united once more under our willful rule."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event21.EVTOPT1: "A resounding success!"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME26: "The Rebellion of Abu Sa'id"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC26: "It appears as though Abu Sa'id has launched a full-fledged rebellion! Obviously, we had no way of preventing this, thus we must focus not on hindsight but on stopping this madman!"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event26.EVTOPT1: "How could we have seen this coming?"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME27: "[TIM.Monarch.GetName] Claims the Timurid Empire"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC27: "[TIM.Monarch.GetName] Has claimed the empire of Tamerlane. Passed from son to son via succession crisis, it appears as though the succession has been decided once and for all."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event27.EVTOPT1: "We shan't tremble, for we are strong as well."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME28: "The Flight to India"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC28: "Our forces lie defeated on the fields of Khorasan, having met their match by ambitious relatives. This is not the end of our empire though! The lands of India are exposed."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event28.EVTOPT1: "All hail Babur!"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event28.EVTOPT2: "We shall not trust another scheming relative..."
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME29: "Karatshar bin Soyurghatmish - The Governor in Kabul"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC29: "In 1444, Afghanistan is ruled by Karatshar bin Soyurghatmish, member of the Timurid Dynasty. Not much is known by his reign, except for the fact that he avoided conflict."
