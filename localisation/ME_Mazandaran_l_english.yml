 maz_luxury_trade_title: "Promote The Luxury Trade"
 maz_luxury_trade_desc: "The Caspian Sea is home to a number of ports selling luxury goods such as silk and incense. Our position puts us in a perfect place to monopolize on this trade and reap the rewards of the Silk Road."
 maz_silk_industry_title: "Develop the Silk Industry"
 maz_silk_industry_desc: "Silk is the backbone of Persian trade, this is no secret. Traders from Cologne to Cathay purchase and distribute silk in Persian markets, and for us to monopolize on this, we need to expand our production of silk."
 maz_monopoly_silk_title: "Monopoly on Silk"
 maz_monopoly_silk_desc: "Our ever expanding Kingdom has an ever expanding need for commerce, but silk is abundant in Persia and its neighboring realms. However, a large amount of silk will do us no good. It is time for a monopoly, a stockpile of silk which no other nation can contest."
 maz_reinforce_amol_title: "Reinforce Amol"
 maz_reinforce_amol_desc: "Amol is the one city lying between us and annexation by the Turks. It is the gateway to the Caspian and a city that should not be neglected. Further development is vital towards our prosperity and protection."
 maz_modernize_army_title: "Modernize the Army"
 maz_modernize_army_desc: "With our focus on survival and interior development, the army itself has been sorely neglected. The rise of gunpowder empires across Asia and development of new military technologies ensures that we cannot fall behind. It is more important than ever that we have a modern and organized army."
 maz_heart_persia_title: "Heart of Persia"
 maz_heart_persia_desc: "The beating heart of Persia consists of cities like Isfahan, Yazd, and Mashhad. Our campaign to unify Persia must encompass the mainland, as these are some of the holiest and most prestigious sites in all of Iran."
 maz_end_turkic_rule_title: "End the Turkic Rule"
 maz_end_turkic_rule_desc: "Finally, the time has come to advance into the heart of the Turkic owned territories. The Timurids have terrorized us for almost a century, but the tables have turned on them. We must seize the day and reclaim Persia for the Persians!"
 maz_rebuild_army_title: "Rebuild the Army"
 maz_rebuild_army_desc: "Mazandaran has been wrought with chaos ever since Timur's invasion; the region never regained its prominence after being ravaged by Turkic forces. Surrounded on all sides by Timurid successor states who want nothing more than to restore Timur's empire proper, a standing army is the first priority to once again being a regional power."
 maz_end_dynastic_feuds_title: "End the Dynastic Feuds"
 maz_end_dynastic_feuds_desc: "Although the Timurid invasion devastated Mazandaran significantly, another factor to our decline has been the countless cadet branches and dynastic quarrels in the region. There are three separate states vying for power, ours included, and even in our state two separate dynasties are threatening to tear the nation apart. It is imperative that we reunite the region before an enemy takes advantage of our fractured state."
 maz_consolidate_taberestan_title: "Consolidate Tabarestan"
 maz_consolidate_taberestan_desc: "The last fortress in Tabarestan left unconquered is the fortress of Golestan, owned by the Khorasani Sultanate. Khorasan is under control of the Timurid sultan, but tensions could boil over at any moment. A Khorasani rebellion is our time to strike and take the province we need."
 maz_southern_expansion_title: "Southern Expansion"
 maz_southern_expansion_desc: "Much of the traditional Persian territory lies to the south; Shiite territories owned by Timurid princes. With chaos sown in Persia, the expansion into Azerbaijan and Ajam should be relatively painless, and establish us as a major player in Persia."
 maz_promote_persian_arts_title: "Promote Persianate Arts"
 maz_promote_persian_arts_desc: "With our conquest of Persia going smoothly, it is no time to neglect the internal affairs. Persia is a historic center of innovation in arts, literature, and government, and it is not time for that to come to a close. However, without proper funding, citizens will see no reason to continue these ancient traditions. For the sake of our legacy, we ought to fund our artists and scientists."
 maz_finalize_persian_conquest_title: "The Persian Conquest"
 maz_finalize_persian_conquest_desc: "Persia has been rightfully conquered, but separatist and religious movements still linger, waiting for an opportune chance to rise up. No conquest is truly finished until the peoples of the nation are quelled and content."
 maz_western_parsis_title: "The Western Parsis"
 maz_western_parsis_desc: "To the west lies mainly the Luris and Azeris, both Persianized to an extent to which we can claim their lands as our own. The fortress of Tabriz, of course, is the centerpiece of the western Persian states. Conquering it for ourselves would grant us great prestige!"
 maz_annex_persian_gulf_title: "Annex the Persian Gulf"
 maz_annex_persian_gulf_desc: "The Persian Gulf is home to some of the wealthiest ports in Asia, and if we were to establish a Persian dynasty of our own, it would be foolish not to annex these territories."
 maz_diplomatic_mission_title: "Diplomatic Missions"
 maz_diplomatic_mission_desc: "Our position politically is precarious. One wrong move would certainly mean our state would cease to exist, so precautions must be taken to prevent any kind of blunder. The diplomatic situation is tense, as Timurid successors circle around the rich Caspian coast like vultures. Regardless, with enough smooth talking, even the most stubborn of princes can grow warm to our Shah."
 maz_forging_alliances_title: "Forging Alliances"
 maz_forging_alliances_desc: "With our diplomats sent abroad to establish cordial relations with the rulers of neighboring nations, the next step is to secure actual alliances. The success of Mazandaran depends on its sovereignty, and without allies, it will be lost without question."
 maz_religious_tensions_title: "Religious Tensions"
 maz_religious_tensions_desc: "We are outcast from the rest of the Middle East because of our faith. This, unsurprisingly, makes it more difficult to find footing in the constantly shifting game of diplomacy. With enough debate and convincing however, the stigma surrounding us can be lessened, making it easier to find allies."
 maz_old_bureaucracy_title: "The Old Bureaucracy"
 maz_old_bureaucracy_desc: "Though many of the bureaucratic elements of Persia's heyday are still in place, the Muslim elements are impossible to notice in any Persianate nation. (ruler name) suggests that we reform the government to be more like the Persian dynasties of old - the Sassanids, Parthians, and Achaemenids. Of course, such reforms could go any direction, but all agree that the bureaucracy is desperately in need of new faces."
 maz_solution_dissent_title: "Solution to Dissent"
 maz_solution_dissent_desc: "Persia is a naturally expansionist state, and with expansion comes rebellion. It is a fact of life that any new territory annexed brings with it groups of nationalists who are far too eager to raise their flags in rebellion. The solution back in ancient times was a system of secret police appointed by the Shah, and in a time where the Middle East is more diverse and irritable than ever, it may do us good to bring it back again."
 maz_return_to_form_title: "A Return to Form"
 maz_return_to_form_desc: "Our embracing of the Zoroastrian faith has not sat well with the majority of the population. The Zoroastrians in Persia have been reduced to a minority, and the Muslims see them as low in the totem pole. With a significant amount of proselytizing, however, the Persian populace could once again embrace the ways of Zoroaster."
 maz_zoroastrian_resurgence_title: "Zoroastrian Resurgence"
 maz_zoroastrian_resurgence_desc: "Zoroaster must look down upon us and be proud. Our nation has already improved on mending the religious tensions, but work is not yet done. Until the majority of Persia is adhering to Zoroastrianism, the rebellions and unrest will continue."
 maz_develop_countryside_title: "Develop the Countryside"
 maz_develop_countryside_desc: "The Muslims of Persia are predominantly agrarian, and cities are few and far between. While there is no problem with the status quo, urbanization would bring many benefits to the populace such as an exchange of ideas as well as increased artisanship."
 maz_islamic_learning_centres_title: "Islamic Centres"
 maz_islamic_learning_centres_desc: "The Islamic Golden Age is long gone, and scholarship is mostly pursued in the west now. That isn't to say that there lies nothing to be discovered. Islam is still a religion that promotes innovation and learning, and we are in a ripe opportunity to revitalize this belief."
 maz_indian_parsi_community_title: "Indian Parsi Communities"
 maz_indian_parsi_community_desc: "With the Gulf Coast under our control, we have a route to India, and direct contact with the Parsis in Gujarat. Distant from Amol itself, the Gujarati Persians are still brothers in culture and faith and we should extend open arms to them."

 #Gilan/Ardabil Events
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.1.t: "A Request From [From.GetName]"
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.1.d: "The Sultan of [From.GetName] has sent an envoy to our court requesting our allegiance when he has conquered all of the Caspian coast. While we deem this highly unlikely, the Safavid order does have strong ties with the court of Gilan, and should they become strong it wouldn't be the worst fate to fight alongside them."
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.1.a: "We will support the Sultan of [From.GetName] however necessary."
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.1.b: "And risk our independence? As if!"
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.2.t: "Ardabil Aligns With Us"
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.2.d: "Our envoy has returned, bearing great news! The Sultan of Ardabil has declared his support for us, and is willing to serve in our court if we manage to conquer the surrounding pretenders."
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.2.a: "Great!"
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.3.t: "Ardabil Refuses to Support Us"
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.3.d: "Our envoy has returned, bearing unfortunate news. The Sultan of Ardabil claims his ambitions outweigh our own, and that he refuses to serve in any court except his own."
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.3.a: "So much for friendship."
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.4.t: "The Promise to Gilan"
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.4.d: "Despite what the advisors have suggested, the Sultan of Gilan has actually managed to consolidate Tabarestan for himself. This presents us with a predicament: fulfill our promise to the Sultan and give up our independence, or become the most dishonorable Sultan in Persia. Either way, we should have intervened a long time ago."
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.4.a: "We have no choice but to keep our word."
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.4.b: "A bad reputation today secures an independent Ardabil tomorrow."
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.5.t: "A Broken Oath"
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.5.d: "The Safavids have blatantly disregarded the oath they gave us those many years ago, that they would join us once we united Mazandaran. This is an act of treachery, and must be acted upon as such."
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.5.a: "If the Sultan will not be our knight, he will be our pawn."
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.6.t: "A Promise Fulfilled"
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.6.d: "The Sultan of Ardabil has remembered his promise to us and has sworn his allegiance. With all the pieces falling in place, our proper title as Shah is only years away from returning to us."
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.6.a: "Great news!"
 me_tab_promise_to_gilan_tt: "By choosing this option we are making a promise to become a vassal of §Y[From.GetName]§! once they form §Y[TAB.GetName]§!. If we break this promise, the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] will retaliate!"

 ME_Mazandaran_Events.7.t: "Mazandarani Power Struggle"
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.7.d: "For decades, Mazandarani politics has been marked by the game of tug of war between the Muslim Marashi dynasty and Zoroastrian Paduspanid dynasty. With all of Mazandaran under our control, the rivalry is fiercer than ever before, and it is clear to everyone that there is no option other than to pick sides."
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.7.a: "Zoroastrian Persia is a relic of the past. We are Muslim."
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.7.b: "The great empires of Persia were Zoroastrian. Glory awaits!"

 ME_Mazandaran_Events.8.t: "Reforming the Bureaucracy"
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.8.d: "Persia has long been ruled under a mix of Persian and Muslim administration, but for a Zoroastrian state, Muslim elements are simply unnecessary. Now is the time to throw off the shackles of Sharia Law and develop a new system of bureaucracy. However, there are many ways to go about it, but the members of court have made it clear that only one area can be focused on."
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.8.a: "Innovation is the key to a thriving government."
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.8.b: "The military is our driving force, it deserves our focus."
 ME_Mazandaran_Events.8.c: "Our success rests on our material goods, focus on developing the land."

 #Form Mazandaran
 form_mazandaran_nation_title: "Unite the Caspian Kingdoms"
 form_mazandaran_nation_desc: "The Caspian coast is dotted with tiny, irrelevant kingdoms, on the verge of succumbing to an invasion at any time by a motivated power. All of because of petty dynastic quarrels. The feuding must end if we are to remain independent, and Mazandaran must be reunited."
