 ath_shooty_shooty_title: "Gunpowder Reforms"
 ath_shooty_shooty_desc: "Shortly after Gunpowder and cannons became widely used, our General Command decided that it was time our Army embraced this new deadly technology as well, to its fullest. By commencing training regimes for our troops, on the use of artillery, we ensure that they are adequately capable of getting the best out of our firing orders."
 ath_capital_title: "For the Capital"
 ath_capital_desc: "By looting and pillaging land that we have conquered, we transfer all important personnel and resources to our capital. This practice, while leaving a bitter taste on our enemies, has greatly helped to increase the Development of our glorious Capital."
 ath_pyrrus_title: "Legacy of Pyrrhus"
 ath_pyrrus_desc: "The Roman Empire at its birth had one major contender; King Pyrrhus, mighty ruler of Epirus. His vision was to transform his home city to an elegant court and a formidable fortress fit for a vicious and victorious King. The fact that he never got to finish his visions means that it befalls on our soldiers and leaders to see through Pyrrhus' magnanimous plans for Epirus. Go forth Athenians! Carry on the Old King's Legacy and rebuild the famed Epirote Forts"
 ath_acropolis_title: "Fortifying the Acropolis"
 ath_acropolis_desc: "Since ancient times, the Acropolis of Athens has been regarded a formidable fort, however with the invention of gunpowder weapons, walls are not as safe as they used to be. Thus we too need to keep up with times, increase our fortification efforts and secure the defense of the city. By copying the layout of the Walls of Constantinople and improving the design, we will erect sufficient fortifications."
 ath_west_title: "Contacts to the West"
 ath_west_desc: "Despite our former Overlord's Religion being Orthodoxy, our roots and allegiance lies with the Italian Catholics. Having grown in size we remind the Westerners that there still is a beacon of Catholicism and western cullture in the Aegean. Thus we will embrace Catholicism and attempt to reach out to the Pope, win favors and build strong alliances in Western Europe."
 ath_old_title: "Out With the Old"
 ath_old_desc: "However thankful we need to be to our royal family, we can't help but notice that the Acciaioli line has not produced stellar rulers, fit to rule and expand our nation. Thus, we retrace our ruling dynasty back to the famed French-Burgundian De La Roche Family, the line that founded and liberated our city. Bring in a new dynasty, fit to carve a path of conquest and prosperity for Athens!"
 ath_sparta_title: "Legacy of Sparta"
 ath_sparta_desc: "Spartans have always been our mortal enemies. However, times have changed, new nations have arrived and our bitter rivalry with the Hoplites of Peloponnisos is but a thing of the past. As a civilized nation with an aspiring military, we need to take Morea, secure what used to be Spartan land and learn more about what made their military so powerful and their Royal Generals so widely-known. It's without a doubt that they know best and their knowledge will benefit our glorious army."
 ath_weak_army_title: "Army Without a Center"
 ath_weak_army_desc: "Thessaly has always been a fertile grassland, lush land with the promise of ample food and enough space to set up new barracks for our glorious army. Thus it's in our interest to take it back, even by force if necessary, and make it into the military center of our expanding country, a breeding and training ground for Athens' finest."
 ath_alexander_title: "Descendants of Alexander"
 ath_alexander_desc: "All Greeks, despite the location of their city-states, are Greeks. Thus, we shall claim the land owned by our ancestors starting from the heart of the famous Macedonian Empire built by Alexander the Great. Retaking the rich state of Macedonia should work both as a boost for our people's morale as well as our economic and military base, further spreading our conquest in the Greek peninsula. With a legitimate and capable monarch on the top, we may lay a claim on the heart of Macedonia, honoring Alexander's memory by returning the land to Greek hands."
 ath_blood_title: "Greatness and Blood"
 ath_blood_desc: "As our soldiers storm the city, the gates of the palace in Thessaloniki open with brutal force. The enemy commander is caught by surprise as his face morphs from mild to sheer terror while watching the Athenian guards surround him. He makes a dash for the exit to no avail. Like a cornered animal he cowers against the wall, begging in a foreign tongue, his eyes wide open and full of panic. With a few decisive steps, the Athenian General grabs his spear and impales the enemy commander on the same corner he sought refuge in while the victim's screams were choked by blood. Chanting, he raises his spear and screams: "The first of many!" The soldiers' screams followed: " Death and honor"! This truly is the beginning of our country's bloodiest campaign, all hail Athens!"
 ath_grand_campaign_title: "Restoring the Glory"
 ath_grand_campaign_desc: "War after war, battle after battle, Athenians keep pushing the front line like an unbreakable iron fist of discipline towards our final and ultimate goal, Constantinople. Its walls high and many, nothing our cannons can't handle. As the cannons sing, the walls crumble and our men storm the breach. Screams, blood, and the confused dismembered soldiers of the enemy running around frenzied, trying to escape the Terror of the Athenian Army while the city's General takes his own life in his quarters. As the last of the defenders' army is is left to die, crossed, on steaks, celebrations commence following great news that the coast of Asia Minor is also under our control. Wine, women and the eternal conviction that this time our newfound nation will last."
 ath_long_text_title: "Independence Day"
 ath_long_text_desc: "Athenians -- that word should have new meaning for all of us today. We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We will be united in our common interests. Perhaps it's fate that today will be a special day, and you will once again be fighting for our freedom, not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution -- but from annihilation.We're fighting for our right to live, to exist. And should we win the day, today will no longer be known as just another day, but as the day when the country declared in one voice, "We will not go quietly into the night! We will not vanish without a fight! We're going to live on! We're going to survive!"
 ath_greatness_title: "Prelude to Greatness"
 ath_greatness_desc: "It starts with the messenger running frenzied along the city forums, yelling at the top of his lungs: "We are Free! Athenians are free! Independence!" and within minutes the city folks cry overjoyed, hugging, teary as they look upon their beloved monarch to turn that momentum of pride and happiness into Athens' very own spot in history. This truly is the beginning and resurgence of a great nation. A prelude to greatness for the books of history to come."
 ath_youwerethechosenone_title: "Expanding the Republic"
 ath_youwerethechosenone_desc: "As our rich republic grows, the populace, the arts and philosophies flourish. However, in order to spread our reputation and lay claim on what's left of Greeks in this hellish world, we need to test our metal, our soldiers and our resolve amidst the wars ahead. To unite the Greeks under one banner, from the Trebizondian mountains to the beautiful Isle of Cyprus and the infamous pirate island of the Knights, Ave Publica!"
 ath_generals_title: "Athenian Generals School"
 ath_generals_desc: "Since the Era of our last Golden Age up until today our glorious country has had to fight tooth and nail to survive and expand, amassing, over the centuries, a great deal of fighting experience on land. From our pioneering tactics against the Persians, to subduing the Sicilians and the Aegean City-States, our army has seen a lot of action. Thus, it would be wise to pass all this knowledge to the next generation of Generals and Sergeants."
 ath_storm_title: "Surviving the Storm"
 ath_storm_desc: "The light of our wise and old Overlord has been extinguished. The Byzantine Empire is dead and we shall mourn their passing in the books of history as great Conquerors and pioneers. In their place, now more than ever we must keep Orthodoxy alive, seek powerful alliances in the east and secure a future for our nation. This truly is the beginning of a new age for Orthodoxy in the Greek lands."
 ath_more_trades_title: "Jack of Many Trades"
 ath_more_trades_desc: "Since the declaration of our Independence, we have laid bare the foundations of a great mercantile people. Through maintaining a steady flow of supplies, safe passage for ships and a populated market we ensure the smooth operation of our newborn Athenian republic. By attracting merchants and their trades from all four corners, we ensure that Athens has to offer the best of all worlds. Silk and Dyes from the East, Slaves and Coffee from the Deserts of Africa, Cloth and Glass from the West."
 ath_we_need_to_build_a_wall_title: "A Legendary Wooden Wall"
 ath_we_need_to_build_a_wall_desc: "For centuries now our craftsmen have improvised, daring sea-sharpened pioneers, each one master in their field. What makes a Navy strong and powerful? Is it the durability of its ships or its men? The number of cannons it carries or its speed? Numbers or Quality? Before the British came around with their fancy hats and uniforms and Queens there was one undisputed Naval Power; Athens. She beckons like a powerful giant forgotten in an age-old slumber, her chains and shackles beg to be removed."
 ath_senate_army_title: "Armed Forces of the Republic"
 ath_senate_army_desc: "Despite the fact that our people are civilized lovers of elections, poetry and culture that does not mean that other countries are nowhere near as modern, civil or educated. We must guard the Republic against the hordes of savages who have their eyes on our territory. Ave Publica! Hail the Republic!"
 ath_aegean_title: "Ports of the Aegean"
 ath_aegean_desc: "Our sea. Millennia ago we used to dominate it. Our foes trembled at the sight of our flags and port cities. Perhaps it's time they feel the same terror again. Sail Forth and make the Republic proud, retake what once was ours and rain fire on the enemies of our great nation."
 ath_league_title: "Athenian League"
 ath_league_desc: "Since ancient times, it was customary for smaller, weaker city-states to give up their independence and pay a fee to a much stronger overlord, capable of protecting them. Thus, with the resurrection of the Athenian Republic, weak fellow neighbors would fit right in our new League. The strong do what they can, the weak suffer what they must."
 ath_golden_age_title: "A Second Golden Age"
 ath_golden_age_desc: "Athens was once perceived to be the centre of creativity, critical and innovative thinking. Perhaps under God's favor we can make another Golden Age happen and reignite the passion of the Athenian people for Arts and Philosophy. Perhaps Athens can regain her status as the world's most innovative city, a forum of thought and creativity."
 ath_ships_title: "Masters of the Trireme"
 ath_ships_desc: "Athenians always knew what made a ship strong. Much like what makes a person's character unique, there's a thousand factors that can make a ship frail or powerful. But, as with everything, we too need to keep up with the times and build a strong navy, for the sake of our prosperity and safety. By investing in quality materials and veteran sailors, our Galleys will be even more formidable that the Berber Pirates."
 ath_admiral_title: "High Admirality School"
 ath_admiral_desc: "Retired Admirals, old Sea Dogs and even infamous Pirates are welcomed into the new High Admiralty School with the prospect of a good salary and transferring their knowledge onto the next generations of Admirals. Through hardened training and copious amounts of practice, the next generation of Commanders will be even more formidable."
