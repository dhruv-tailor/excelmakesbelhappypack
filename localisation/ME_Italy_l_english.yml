The construction of a railway network was the goal that attracted the greatest financial commitment. Since malaria had slowed down the construction of railways in several places, particularly in the center-south, interest in the sanitation struggle grew beyond that the will to create employment in large uninhabited and marshy areas. In Emilio Broglio he noted that, in the Po valley, the problem of malaria was considerably reduced with simple hydraulic reclamations; while from the south of the Apennines a set of much more complex and expensive works was required, not yet feasible at the time.

The Lombard invasion had definitively broken the unity created by Rome, and in the North the municipalities had given a special impetus to history, while in the South the kingdom of the Swabians, Anjou, Spain and the Bourbons had another. On the one hand, the tradition of a certain autonomy had created a bold bourgeoisie full of initiatives, and there was an economic organization similar to that of other European states, conducive to the further development of capitalism and industry. On the other, the paternal administrations of Spain and the Bourbons had created nothing: the bourgeoisie did not exist, agriculture was primitive and was not even enough to satisfy the local market; no roads, no ports, no use of the few waters that the region possessed due to its special conformation. The unification put the two parts of the peninsula in intimate contact."

 # Events:
 ME_Italy_Events.1.T: "Monumento dei Quattro mori"
 ME_Italy_Events.1.D: "The monument stands in front of the small dock that the Grand Duke Ferdinando I de 'Medici had excavated at the end of the sixteenth century to expand the port of Livorno; the sculptural group, located near the mighty walls, would thus attest to the grand-ducal authority in the eyes of the numerous travelers who would have stopped in Livorno. The work consists of the Four Moors in bronze chained to the base of a high pedestal, above which the statue of Ferdinand I himself rises. The Grand Duke is represented with the uniform of the Order of the Knights of Santo Stefano, the institution military founded by Cosimo I de 'Medici to fight the Ottomans and the racing war in the Mediterranean Sea. The Quattro Mori however constitute the most important part of the work: the accentuated twists (borrowed from Giambologna's style) and the grimaces of pain well represent the prison condition of the subjects, which is sublimated in a set of great realism and elegance. In fact, Pietro Tacca took as a model some of the Moors imprisoned in the bathroom of the convicts, the vast prison located a short distance from the Old Fortress. The first two places on the front of the monumental complex represent a vigorous man, the younger of the others, known by the name of Morgiano and perhaps of Greek or Ionian origin, with his gaze turned towards the sky. He is paired with the old corsair on the right corner, traditionally known as Alì Melioco, of Turkish origin. The couple of rear statues were placed at the base of the monument only later. The first corsair, of North African ethnicity and known by the name of Alì Salettino (from the city of Salé), represents the vigor of mature age, still with a powerful and energetic physique. Finally, the fourth is of clear sub-Saharan African origin. "

The waters of the valley, through the Toce river, flow into the Ticino, making this river the richest in gold in Italy. The Guia mine is not the only mine in the valley nor the largest, in fact there are dozens of them, and the most developed has an extension of 80 km of tunnels. \nThe total length of the tunnels is 12 km, spread over 11 levels, three below the entry level, but now completely flooded by water due to infiltrations, and another six above."
