 ## Descriptions:
 Italy_Genoan_Trade_desc: "The region of Genoa has been a global trade center for centuries; a hub for merchants on their way through the Silk Road. Our government must seize the flow of goods in this region, and start making a name for ourselves."
 Italy_Fortify_The_North_desc: "The Alps serve as natural defensive terrain from northern invaders, but it has been neglected by our administration. We must build forts along the major pathways throughout the Alps to stop invaders before they reach the Peninsula."
 Italy_Invade_France_desc: "The French control over the Genoan trade node as well as the areas of Provence and Savoy threaten our economy and our borders, respectively. We must see French influence removed from these regions."
 Italy_Conquer_France_desc: "The French [FRA.Monarch.GetTitle], [FRA.Monarch.GetName] rules a broken Kingdom with a crumbling legacy. It is only time before foreign powers intervene to sieze land for themselves; we must be the first, and the only. Glory to Italia!"
 Italy_England_desc: "The island of Great Britain would serve as an excellent strongpoint for our expansion into the New World. We must strike at the English quickly and with haste, before their overseas colonies become too powerful."
 Italy_Mare_Nostrum_desc: "Our Sea, the Mediterranean once divided, is now in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ hands. Years of conquering and integration has finally led us to a sea-spanning Empire. Our merchants boom off of trade out of Venice and Genoa; our clergymen cheer on at our mastery of the $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ faith; and our nobles relax at the thought of an invincible Italia. It is time to realise our greatest dreams, and declare ourselves a new Rome. Gloria à Roma!"
 Italy_South_Italian_Dev_desc: "Our southern states should not be neglected; they are susceptible to naval invasions from our enemies, and must be grown to accomodate larger garrisons."
 Italy_South_Italian_Buildings_desc: "To ensure the prosperity of our people in the south, we must improve the infrastructure to accomodate the influx of population."
 Italy_Piedmont_desc: "The area of Piedmont is carved from highlands and hills, serving as an excellent defensive point for our men. With these lands in our hands, protecting our people from the French will become easier."
 Italy_Lombardy_desc: "We must expand our borther in the Northern Alps to protect ourselves from the horrors of the Holy Roman Empire. Brescia serves as a powerful defensive position; it must be ours."
 Italy_Reform_Forces_desc: "We are the true rulers of Italia, and it must show in our army strength. We must cast the shadow over our enemies that they will never see the sunlight again."
 Italy_Baleares_desc: "The islands of the Baleares, long owned by the Aragonese, would serve as an excellent base for our further expansion into the Spanish mainlands."
 Italy_Aragone_desc: "In order to put true pressure on the French, we must show them we are capable of arriving at their doorstep in an instant. [ARA.Monarch.GetName], [ARA.Monarch.GetTitle] of Aragon rules over land that could prove useful for this. Controlling his lands would allow us easy access into the Pyrenees and to French soil."
 Italy_Hispainia_desc: "With the threat of Aragon removed from the Peninsula, the rest of Iberia is ripe for the taking. We must rule over all Iberia, before the French intervene to seize land for themselves."
 Italy_Pyrenees_desc: "We must concecrate defensive forts along the southern side of the Pyrenees to deter the French from a first strike. They dare not cross into our borders then."
 Italy_Antiochia_desc: "As once the Byzantines held Antioch, so shall we. All of Christendom shall honour us as our hold on the Holy City rightens our claims of greatness. Antioch, the cradle of Christianity, fell to the scourge of Islam many years ago; it must be retaken. For Italia, or none at all!"
 Italy_Jerusalem_desc: "Jerusalem, a city to rival even Rome itself, has been held by the Islamist heathens for centuries, mocking our religion and losening our claim to the city. It must be held by Christian hands once again."
 Italy_Mexico_desc: "We must not let the riches of the New World be directed to our rivals in the west. Controlling the substantial amount of gold flowing in from Mexico should serve as a hinderance to our enemies, and fill our coffers too."
 Italy_Panama_desc: "The region of Panama is too valuable and prosperous to be left to our neighbours. Seizing the trade that pours to Europe from Panama will fill us with capital we could only dream of."
 Italy_Development_desc: "In order to lay down a foundation for our administration to expand the industrial and societal capacity of our homeland, we must unite all Italian peoples under our banner; only then will we all prosper."
 Italy_Sardinian_Dev_desc: "The islands we control in the Mediterranean are the most susceptible to attacks from our neighbours. In order to properly prevail against these invaders, we must develop said lands to incorporate more garrisons and populace."
 Italy_Sardinian_Buildings_desc: "Although Sardinia is generally used as defensive terrain, prosperous cities such as [2986.GetName] and [1247.GetCapitalName] are emerging. Creating state infrastructure there could greatly improve the wealth of these cities, and in return, our wealth."
 Italy_Pax_Italica_desc: "Once a land of foreign intervention by the Great Powers that surround us, we have grown to surpass those powers, and become one of our own. A true nation leads its people to victory, not its king. With properly maintained state infrastructure and a booming populace, we have become one of the most prestigious nations in the world. Italia once raised her banner to the sky to seek the day that no boundary will separate the Italian peoples - this day has come, and now she rests her banner on the doorstep of Rome, the city to overcome the world. Glory to Italia!"
 Italy_Invade_Naples_desc: "The diplomatic solution to Naples' integration has failed, and they have cut off all ties with our administration. The time for war has come, and in it, we must be victorious. Dominion over Naples will decide our fate in the Peninsula - if we cannot control them, we will succumb to being controlled ourselves."
 Italy_Conquer_Naples_desc: "Although Naples has closer ties to the Iberian countries or Aragon and Castile, they are still located on the Italian Peninsula. We cannot call ourselves a united nation without Naples under our direct rule."
 Italy_Seize_Islands_desc: "In an effort to gain control over Mediterranean trade and to secure more defensible terrain from foreign invaders in the Mediterranean, our military generals have come to us with a proposal: siege the islands of Sicily and Sardinia. Forward bases could be constructed there, increasing our hold over the Mediterranean by allowing us to challenge any ships that pass through the Tyrrenean Sea."
 Italy_Unite_Itallians_desc: "We have finally gained control over the entire Italian Peninsula - a goal that could only be accomplished by the brave peoples of [ROOT.GetName]. Now, we call forth the final instrument: the unification of Italy. Under one banner we are stronger, undivivisble — and most importantly, ready to take on the challenge of spreading our newfound Kingdom to its limits. Glory to Italia!"
 Italy_Mediterranean_Ambitions_desc: "Launching campaign into the Mediterranean and beyond does not come with its burdens. We must have the naval and military prowess required to back this campaign, as well as an acquired prestige with the nations of Europe. We cannot begin our campaign without this."
 Italy_Rhodes_desc: "Without a doubt, the most difficult task of this campaign will be the subjugation of the now-rising Ottoman Empire. [KNI.Monarch.GetName] controls the island of Rhodes - a perfect province for staging an invasion of Anatolia. We just have to gain control over the province first, by any means necessary."
 Italy_Greece_desc: "The region of Greece was a historically important region to the Romans. Constantinople had been a city of the Romans since 324 AD. Since then, it has grown into the most central hub for trade for the silk road. It, and the surrounding region must be ours."
 Italy_Greece_North_desc: "Alexander the great is considered one of history's most successful military commanders. If we are to follow in his legacy of reclaiming the Mediterranean, we must hold the lands of Macedonia and the surrounding provinces."
 Italy_Bulgaria_desc: "In order to gain a foothold in the Black Sea, we must first own the coastline of Bulgaria. This will allow us uninterfered trade from the Black Sea straight to Venice and Genoa. No nation has bravely stood up to the massacre that was the Crusade of Varna - we must be the first to avenge the fallen."
 Italy_Across_The_Strait_desc: "Anatolia, once a region torn by petty wars and the rise of Islam, must be united under our rule. This will come soon enough, for now we must settle with the Anatolian coastline to let the heretics know we come in force."
 Italy_Anatolia_desc: "The region of Anatolia has been transformed into one of the luckiest regions in the East: it is controlled by us. Long have the heretic islamists challenged our rule of the east - going as far as to slay many kings for control of the Balkans - today, their dominion ends. It shall be known that Italia is the true Master of the East."
 Italy_Discover_America_desc: "Our admirals and officers tell us of riches in a far away land; a land so vast that laying claim to it all would make us the richest in all of Europe. Let the gold flow into our coffers, but first let's tell our men to set sail!"
 Italy_Caribbean_desc: "It seems that our admirals were correct! \"This new world is full of riches, my lord! Gold and sunshine as far as the eyes can see!\" the sailor said to me, kneeled before the court and praising the joy of this new world. I think a vacation is in order."
 Italy_Brazil_desc: "As our explorers document and map more and more of this \"New World\", we can start expanding our influence to greater heights. There is land due south of the Carribean; it must be ours."
 Italy_Argentina_desc: "There are lands south of Brazil in which our explorers tell is made entirely from silver. Let us take advantage of this news, and declare ourselves the owner of this \"Argentino.\""
 Italy_North_Italian_Dev_desc: "Our northern lands are our pride and joy! Milan, Florence, Piedmont, Ferrara, all wealthy provinces under the rule of Italy. Why not make them richer?"
 Italy_North_Italian_Buildings_desc: "To accomodate the influx of population and trade into the region of Northern Italy, we must build buildings to ensure the safety of our people."
 Italy_Doge_desc: "The Doge of Venice - a title granted to republican cowards who do not know the glory of absolutism - hides on his island drawing trade away from the Peninsula. These atrocious criminals must be brought to justice under new Italian rule. Their heads must roll."
 Italy_South_Tirol_desc: "Athough South Tirol has been German for hundreds of years, controlling it would give us an advantage over northern invaders. It is easy to defend, and covered in hills and mountains. We will need this if we come into aggression with the Germans again."
 Italy_Albania_desc: "The region of Albania opposes us at the entrance to the Adriatic Sea. If we controlled it, we could critically hinder other nations' trade in and out of the sea, and tax it as we please."
 Italy_Adriatic_Coast_desc: "Controlling Albania will not be enough to fufill our needs. We must own all of the Adriatic Coast if we are to truly cut off opposing trade in the region. See to it that this happens."
 Italy_Slavs_desc: "The Slavs are in the way of our campaign for the Mediterranean. If we are to complete this, they must no longer follow their flag."
 Italy_Exploration_desc: "Our ships are ready and our explorers are set. Let us sail to these newly discovered lands, and make ourselves a new empire!"
 Italy_The_Rock_desc: "To truly cut the heathens out of Iberia, we must control both sides of the Gibraltar Strait. With total control, nobody enters or leaves the Mediterranean without our permission."
 Italy_Around_Africa_desc: "Our explorers tell us of the most southern point of Africa. This means that we can sail around it, and reach the Middle East from the other side. Let us mark it on the map."
 Italy_Ivory_Coast_desc: "The Ivory Coast is filled with riches and gold beyond the eyes can see. Let us lay claim before other nations get the chance. Or, we could steal it from them afterwards."
 Italy_South_Africa_desc: "Since we already know about the Cape, it would be wise of us to claim it and settle there so we can control the flow of transport around the most important location of Africa."
 Italy_Mozambthicc_desc: "We have learned of the region of Zanzibar, a place so rich that even influencial sultanates have resided there. We need to control it, and become one step closer to uniting all of Africa."
 Italy_Gulf_of_aden_desc: "The many sultanates of the Middle East tell us about the Gulf of Aden. As the entry point into the Red Sea, they say more trade flows through than flows throughout all of the Mediterranean. We must occupy the surrounding lands of the Gulf immediately to capitalize on this new trade."
 Italy_India_desc: "Why go through the trouble of a middleman when you control the source? The many Spices that flow into Europa originate from India. We must own it all - then countries will be forced to trade with us else they lose out on their spices."
 Italy_Genoa_desc: "Although we already dominate the Genonan region on land, we must capitalize on the trade there as well. Let us tell the others that we are not to be trifled with."
 Italy_Tunis_desc: "Sometimes, the easiest way to get rich is to steal from the locals. Let us dominate the Tunis trade region and rob the southern heretics of their goods."
 Italy_Sevilla_desc: "Controlling the trade in through the Mediterranean must be our new priority. Allowing other nations to freely trade in and out of the Mediterranean undermines our power and reduces our claims on the surrounding lands. This is an important region - we must be successful."
 Italy_Safi_desc: "If the trade is from Africa, it eventually reaches the region of Safi. The Africans have used this region as a trade center for centuries. It is time we dominated it. For the greater good of Italia, or the greater good of none."
 Italy_Colonial_Ambitions_desc: "We have successfully united all of Italia under our rule, but our administrators yearn for something more. Some influencials in court have proposed the idea of creating a fleet for the sole purpose of exploration, like the Phoneticians and the like did many years ago."
 Italy_Discover_Something_desc: "In order to test if this new fleet is worth the troube, we must send them on an expedition. If they return with information on new lands, then we will have to prepare more fleets for exploration. Who knows, maybe there is a world beyond the eyes of Europe."
 Italy_Tunisia_desc: "In a galaxy far, far away, there existed a sultanate known as Tunisia. In this galaxy, Tunisia is conquered for the greater good of Italia. We must make them see the true ways of God, or suffer."
 Italy_Libya_desc: "A stronghold in Libya will allow us better access to Egypt and the surrounding lands. If it was controlled by the Romans, it will be controlled by us."
 Italy_Cyrenaica_desc: "Influence over the eastern region of Egypt is vital to crushing the Middle Eastern sultanates. We must drive out the heretic armies that oppose us there, and put a dent in the [357.Owner.GetAdjective] stance in Egypt."
 Italy_Desert_desc: "Altough a useless region to most other kingdoms in Europe, the desert south of Tunisia would prove useful for further colonization into Africa. We must conquer these lands and move quickly to secure dominance over the region."
 Italy_Algeria_desc: "There is no harm in controlling more African land, so let us take control of the region of Algeria to further cement our mastery of Africa. Soon, all sultanates will learn to bow their knee to Italia."
 Italy_Morocco_desc: "The Sultanate of Morocco has been a threat to Iberia ever since the Moorish invasion. We must control Morocco entirely, so that history may not repeat itself."
 Italy_Maghreb_desc: "From [236.GetName] to [361.GetName], our dominion over the Maghreb region has left others in awe of our true power. This is a big step in the strengthening of italia, and will let other nations know what happens when you stand in the way of our armies. The campaign for the Mediterranean has only just begun. Glory to Italia!"
 Italy_Egypt_desc: "Now it is time to drive the Islamic control of Egypt into our hands. [361.GetName] must be ours, and the other sultanates must join Italia or be wiped from the map forever. After constant infighting and being pushed around by our neighbours, we have truly reached a point where nobody can stand in the way of our might. The Earth roars with vigor as we cleanse her of the mire that plagues the lands. Glory to Italia!"
 Italy_Venice_desc: "Dominance over the Venetian trade region is essential to a powerful Italia. Now that Venice has been brought under our direct control, we can start to infuence the trade in the region. Venice is one of the most wealthy regions in all of Europe; we cannot miss out on this opportunity and let another nation rob us of our gold."
 Italy_Ragusa_desc: "The trade region of Ragusa is vital to securing trade in the east. Controlling it will limit Austrian influence in the region, and push ourselves into other trade regions besides Venice and Genoa."
 Italy_Alexandria_desc: "Not many traders live without having seen Alexandria at least once. This trade region is so vital for goods between Europa and the East that it has grabbed the attention of our merchant guilds. They want better access, so let us go and take it ourselves."
 Italy_Constantinople_desc: "Constantinople: the City of the World's Desire. It is obvious why controlling trade in this region is of our utmost importance. Constantinople is biggest trade post through the silk road, which means that expensive goods from the east pass through. Those goods must be ours, and the trade region of Constantinople must be dominated by Italia alone."
