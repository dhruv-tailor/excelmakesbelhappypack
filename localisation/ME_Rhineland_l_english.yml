 # Missions:
 RHN_franconia_title: "A Mere Obstacle"
 RHN_franconia_desc: "While we proclaim that we are the nation of Rhineland, we were perhaps too hasty in our judgement. For instance, we have not yet seized control of the various neighboring territories that jointly inhabit the Rhine, posing a significant threat to our safety. Logically speaking, they should be our next target."
 RHN_swabia_title: "Follow the Rhine South"
 RHN_swabia_desc: "Swabia is both developed and ripe for the picking. Though the area is under the protection of the Holy Roman Emperor, we should be able to take it anyway, peacefully or by force."
 RHN_bavaria_title: "But a Thorn in our Side"
 RHN_bavaria_desc: "The Baravian region presents both a threat and an opportunity. Their strength and power is a threat, but if incoroporated into our great nation, it could prove a decent manpower--and beer--source for exploitation. Thus to satisfy both the doctrines of defense and attack, we must invade."
 RHN_westphalia_title: "Secure Westfalen"
 RHN_westphalia_desc: "Though we may already control some of Westphalia, it is best not to leave a people divided between two nations. As a mercy to their ethnicity, we must invade the rest of Westphalia and assert our control to reunite the self-imposed schism."
 RHN_saxony_title: "King of the Germans"
 RHN_saxony_desc: "Saxony has long since been a thorn in our side, blocking expansion to the east. No more. The Saxons shall know their place under the glory of Rhineland."
 RHN_lower_saxony_title: "In Pursuit of Silver"
 RHN_lower_saxony_desc: "The Rhenish Nation and its immediate neighborhood demands for luxurious goods. Rhineland, being the industrial center of Western Europe, shall provide for the demand, and to achieve that, the Silver produced in Lower Saxony and [57.GetName] must be seized."
 RHN_manufactories_title: "Adopt the Manufakturen"
 RHN_manufactories_desc: "Entrepeneurs in other states are already setting up workplaces of mass production. Why shouldn't we get in on the 'Manufactories'? Let us go to great lengths to invest into this new technology, for the only way to stay ahead of our neighbors is proper investment."
 RHN_workshops_title: "The Prelude to Brilliance"
 RHN_workshops_desc: "The Rhenish nation dreams, and it dreams big. But before the ambitions of the nation can be achieved, we must start simple. It is of utmost importance that we construct additional infrastructure, as the current one doesn't seem enough to get our nation on its feet. Soonafter, we may begin greater projects."
 RHN_the_guard_on_rhine_title: "Die Wacht am Rhein"
 RHN_the_guard_on_rhine_desc: "The proximity of the French forces is worrying at best. The tensions have been high for quite some time, and it is not all that unlikely that the French will finally vie for the control of Western Germany, as they've done numerous time. We must put our watchmen on the Rhine so as to prevent the French from ever achieving their audicious natural borders."
 RHN_press_title: "Benefits of the Print"
 RHN_press_desc: "Recently, for in the 1440s, Johannes Gutenberg, a brilliant Rhenish mind, became the father of the European Printing Press, forever-changing the intellectual landscape of the old continent. Thanks to his invention, we can now reap the benefits of this ground-shaking invention."
 RHN_fine_german_print_title: "Fine German Print"
 RHN_fine_german_print_desc: "The Printing Press was invented in Rhineland, so it is only natural that we become the center and the staple of the fine german print. We shall invoke a chauvinist attitude towards our book wares, making them a symbol of quality and dissemination of knowledge."
 RHN_press_and_the_faith_title: "The Faith and the Press"
 RHN_press_and_the_faith_desc: "With firm grip on the Press within our state, we can push our agendas as we will, and in this ever-more conflict-ridden times, unity is something that we need. Aforementioned unity can be achieved with an intervention in our press, thanks to which we could promote religious tolerance, or to grow the religious unity within our country by religious press."
 RHN_copper_foundries_title: "Appropriation of Kopfer"
 RHN_copper_foundries_desc: "Rhineland has been with vast amounts of resources. Among those is Copper, an important component of metals such as Brass and Bronze. Being localized in the vicinity of [83.GetName], it is in prime position for exploitation. We shall make an excellent use of it in our goal of industrialization!"
 RHN_optics_title: "Kasseler Optics"
 RHN_optics_desc: "The backbone of Rhenish industry isn't just one, few, or many, but all resources. This includes glass, which has seen many new uses for it being discovered recently. One of those is the production of optics, with which we hope to open up new trade links to major naval powers."
 RHN_moselle_title: "Moselle Thrives"
 RHN_moselle_desc: "While not all of Rhineland is covered with valuable resource deposits, it doesn't meant that the regions left out must remain abandoned. The Moselle Valley is one of those areas, and we shan't let it decay. Under our guidance, not only will the lands surrounding Moselle not deteriotate, but they will thrive and prosper."
 RHN_zinc_title: "Zinc Deposits of Rhineland"
 RHN_zinc_desc: "Having put our Copper into more uses, it is time we grow the scale, at which resources are extracted from the ground. One of those resources that we will certainly need more of is Zinc, the basis for the production of the Brass alloy. Currently it is excavated in [4768.GetName], but there is also more than enough evidence that a large-scale extraction could be established in [81.GetName]."
 RHN_german_tin_title: "Monopolize German Tin"
 RHN_german_tin_desc: "While the facilities for Tin are of plenty in Germany, the largest and most significant ones are probably in [1757.GetName]. The area must be seized from the current holder, and we must erect appropriate infrastructure so as to monopolize this necessary resource."
 RHN_jewellery_title: "Producing Jewellery"
 RHN_jewellery_desc: "While profits can be made by selling anything, one of the most profitable industries that we know of is definitely producing all kinds of Jewellery. Greatly desired by all noble families of Europe; "
 RHN_iron_title: "Grow the Steel Industry"
 RHN_iron_desc: "Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon that results in the creation of a much-more durable material than its components. Currently though, its usage is far from widespread and the field hasn't seen any innovations in recent history. It's high time this material gets the attention it deserves."
 RHN_ruhrgebiet_title: "Ruhrgebiet"
 RHN_ruhrgebiet_desc: "The valley of Ruhr is in hightly strategic position, as it is in the prime spot to be a center of ore processing and advanced metallurgy. The area has already began thriving since our successful efforts in growing the steel industry, and we must let the area become the most prospering aglomeration Central Europe has to offer."
 RHN_military_industry_title: "Military Industry"
 RHN_military_industry_desc: "The main purposes of growing national industries is to acquire a budget that would fuel further improvements. Not all developments have to serve that purpose though. Military concerns are just as important, if not more so. The value of our provinces grows, attracting many wolves, and we must be strong enough to fight back such wolfpack."
 RHN_coal_title: "A Precursor to a Revolution"
 RHN_coal_desc: "Coal is certainly an underappreciated resource. Mined for several purposes, its extraction isn't vast and definitely doesn't form an important sector in the mining business. However, it seems like there's much more to coal than it is currently thought. Perhaps it is the time to give it a try?"
 RHN_blast_furnaces_title: "Technology of Hochofen"
 RHN_blast_furnaces_desc: "Blast Furnaces are metallurgical devices used to smelt all kinds of resources. Unfortunately though, they are currently severely underused. We shall reveal the true advantages this technology has to offer."
 RHN_fill_the_land_title: "Shake the Ground"
 RHN_fill_the_land_desc: "Let us fill our provinces with Blast Furnaces. Let us project the power of our innovative technologies. All nations in Europe shall marvel at the Rhenish Lands, emitting the light of the Industrial Revolution that will forever change the course of history."
 RHN_center_of_europe_title: "The Center of Europe"
 RHN_center_of_europe_desc: "Rhineland, near the center, a bit to the side, truly the heart of Europe, both geographically, culturally and industrially. After all of our efforts, is there really someone who hasn't heard of the famed Rhenish Quality? Is there a despot, a ruler, a noble who doesn't own Rhenish Books, Rhenish Jewellery? The prevalent Rhenish Optic lead navies to victory, while the Rhenish military complex dominates."
 RHN_leather_title: "Agricultural Revolution"
 RHN_leather_desc: "No industry shall be left behind. One sector left largely unaffected is the agriculture, which hasn't seen no developments under our management. It's high time we changed that!"
 RHN_religion_title: "Religion des Rheinlands"
 RHN_religion_desc: "In this age of religious conflict, we must embrace the new faith or reject the reformation. Whatever our choice will be, it will have a profound impact on the present and the future."

 RHN_scientific_title: "Technocratic Support"
 RHN_scientific_desc: "Innovation will not be achieved through advice of corruptible persons chosen by their ancestry, but through highly-esteemed individuals driven by their talent and desire to improve. Only those people will truly adhere to the interests of the state."
 RHN_united_rheinzoll_title: "United Rheinzoll"
 RHN_united_rheinzoll_desc: "Currently each province has its own, independent toll on crossing the Rhine. This leads to much chaos and loopholes, which many clever merchants take advantage of. We must put a stop to this, and we can achieve that by unifying the complex web of tolls into a single toll, easy to understand and convenient for all domestic and foreign merchants alike."
 RHN_standing_army_title: "Stehendes Heer"
 RHN_standing_army_desc: "In warfare, there are no constant conditions. The old system of levies, while effective in the past, is slowly falling out of use, displaced by the standing armies. We cannot be left behind other european powers, we too, must transition our army into a permanent force."
 RHN_encroaching_french_title: "Encroaching French"
 RHN_encroaching_french_desc: "While it may seem friendly, the French State is slowly approaching our borders, waiting for an opportune moment to strike and seize what their deranged ideology considers as theirs. We shan't be surprised by their treason, we shall the be first to deal the blow!"

 #events:
 ME_Rhenish_Events.1.t: "Emergence of the Renaissance in [Root.GetName]"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.1.d: "A revolutionary evolution in modern arts has swept across Europe. Though originating in Italy, it has spread like a tidal wave across Germany, taking root in even [Root.GetName]. We would do well to foster such an advent, though to what end we are unsure."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.1.a: "Hire a local Humanist."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.1.b: "Patronize the Arts."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.1.c: "Fund a Renaissance Building."
 
 ME_Rhenish_Events.2.t: "Benefits of the Press"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.2.d: "With the invention of Printing Press by Johannes Gutenberg in the middle of first century brought a true revolution to the daily life of Europeans. With Printing Press being embraced by cities throught Europe, books became accessible to the middle class allowing spread of new ideas to lower social layers. Now, with Printing Press embraced by our state, we are able to use this revolutionary technique to our advantage. We can exploit this in several ways; filling the press with Propaganda, institute an extra tax or try to promote literacy."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.2.a: "Make it affordable for the peasantry too!"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.2.b: "Promote Interests of our State"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.2.c: "Institute an Extra Tax"
 
 ME_Rhenish_Events.3.t: "The Matters of Faith in the Press"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.3.d: "The Printing Press has enabled the crown to proliferate information at an astounding rate, never before seen to Europe. Both its efficiency and efficacy know no bounds. To this end, we should utilize such a machination to promote our religious policy. Through tolerance or strife, the printing press shall prove invaluable to our adminstration."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.3.a: "We should promote our faith in the times of need."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.3.b: "We shall strive for tolerance!"
 
 ME_Rhenish_Events.4.t: "A Trading Partner"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.4.d: "Optics are used for many purposes. They are used as a mean to correct eyesight problems, a tool for reconaissance, and they are, most importantly, a vital part of the naval combat. Unfortunately, [RHN.GetName] being an inland nation, it can't use the spectacles to their fullest potential. Therefore, it would be an excellent idea to find a powerful naval power willing to purchase these."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.4.a: "Send [Rhineland_target_1.GetName] an offer."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.4.b: "We are sure to come to an agreement with [Rhineland_target_2.GetName]."

 ME_Rhenish_Events.5.t: "A Most Generous Offer"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.5.d: "We have been offered, by the mighty nation of Rhineland, a rather significant and continuous shipment of naval glasswork and optic equipment, extremely useful for maritime ventures. We lack the proper facilities to procure this equipment at a similar rate to those of Rhenish origin, thus we cannot rule out the possible gains from trade."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.5.a: "Accept the offer!"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.5.b: "We can produce anything we need ourselves."
 
 ME_Rhenish_Events.6.t: "Zinc in Oberhessen"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.6.d: "Despite excavating zinc in the province of [4768.GetName], a rising Industrial Power of [RHN.GetName] is bound to require more Zinc than a single mine can produce. We do know that Oberhessen has large zinc deposits that could be exploited. However, large-scale exploitation would hurt the current industry in Oberhessen."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.6.a: "Embrace the Zinc!"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.6.b: "The current industry is just too precious."
 
 ME_Rhenish_Events.7.t: "Leather Processing"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.7.d: "Since the dawn of humanity, Livestock was farmed so as to produce meat and leather, which would later go on to be eaten or sold. Now, with the advent of Advanced Leather Processing in [leather_province.GetName], the technology has begun to spread, and consequently, the demand for the Livestock produce has increased significantly. Now, the livestock is farmed en masse, so as to meet the demand of this rising industry."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.7.a: "Wonderful!"
 
 ME_Rhenish_Events.8.t: "The Coal Industry"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.8.d: "As it currently stands, Coal exploitation is far from being the central part of our economy. However, there are rumours of there being much more to the resource than we initially thought. It might be profitable to begin a large-scale exploitation of the resource, albeit gradually."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.8.a: "By all means, let us proceed!"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.8.b: "Coal? It's a recipe for a disaster."
 
 ME_Rhenish_Events.9.t: "Advanced Faceting"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.9.d: "Following the discovery of advanced faceting techniques that happened in the dawn of Renaissance, many have begun trying to best these ways. Those attempts have resulted in little to no advances in the field until this day. Recently, a Rhenish gem-cutter discovered a new method in diamond-cutting which caused the Jewellery produced in [diamond_province.GetName] to excel not just in quality, but also beauty. [diamond_province.GetName], in addition to the current [old_diamond_province.GetName], will be a new seat of the global jewel-making."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.9.a: "Old pave the way for the new."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.9.b: "Gems are truly outrageous."
 
 ME_Rhenish_Events.10.t: "The Crisis in [BRG.GetName]"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.10.d: "The ruler of [BRG.GetName] has died unexpectedly. As per the inheritance treaty signed with the local dynasty, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is to succeed in [BRG.GetName]."
 ME_Rhenish_Events.10.a: "This is more than ideal!"
 
 ME_Rhenish_Events.11.t: "New Industry in Moselle Valley"
 ME_Rhenish_Events.11.d: "With increased industral capacity giving way to further exports, we find our manufactories overworked in the Moselle Valley. Though we could alleviate the problem, we have received suggestions regarding the state-sponsored production in the region. Should we lay back agricultural subsidies and instead allow our loggers to go to work, we might yet find ourselves a profitable new source of timber for our future projects."
