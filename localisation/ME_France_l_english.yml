 ME_France_Events.33.T: "Jewish Communities"
 ME_France_Events.33.D: "Jewish communities in France have never been shy nor have they been small in numbers. Prosecuted and chased out because of their beliefs, the Jews have never had a place to call their home. We can invite them into our nation and place a system which will keep them in check and by doing so we can easily gain their loyalty and reduce the power of the local lords at the same time"

 ME_France_Events.34.T: "The Taille"

 ME_France_Events.34.OPT2: "We should look for funding methods elsewhere."

 ME_France_Events.35.T: "To Bleed a Peasant Dry"

 ME_France_Events.35.OPT1: "Abolish the taille."
 ME_France_Events.35.OPT2: "Our economic dependence on the taille is too high for us to simply abolish it"

 ME_France_Events.36.T: "The Rise of a New Profession"
 ME_France_Events.36.D: "Silk is a natural fiber some forms of which can be woven into textiles.

 ME_France_Events.36.OPT2: "Invest in the current industry of Lyon"

 ME_France_Events.37.T: "The Enemy of my Enemy..."
 ME_France_Events.37.D: "The Habsburg power has been growing out of control. With their title as Holy Roman Emperor they have continued to fund their rivalry against us by using the imperial princes. But as the old saying goes; "The enemy of my enemy is my friend" and for that reason we have found an unusual ally in an unusual place. The Ottoman Turks have been very receptive of our anti-Austrian cause. We should send a mission to Constantinople to agree on some final terms with them."

 ME_France_Events.40.T: "A Good King"
 ME_France_Events.40.D: "With the rise of Reformists in our court, many have started questioning the supremacy of Catholicism inside France. The Reformists are asking for religion not to be a requirement for a monarch's legitimacy."
 ME_France_Events.40.OPT1: "Faith should not dictate the identity of our monarch."
 ME_France_Events.40.OPT2: "We should keep our ancient customs"

 ME_France_Events.41.T: "Maximillien de Bethune"
 ME_France_Events.41.D: "Maximilien de Béthune; born in mantes-la-jolie has displayed bravery in the field and particular ability as a military engineer. He acted as Henry's special agent in Paris. Once Henry's succession to the throne was secured the faithful and trusted Maximilien received his reward in the shape of numerous estates and dignities."
 ME_France_Events.41.OPT1: "Invite him into our court."
 ME_France_Events.41.OPT2: "Make him the governor of Normandy."

 ME_France_Events.42.T: "The End of a Dream?"
 ME_France_Events.42.D: "The Roman Empire, whose prestige and dominance has not been matched till this day, has always been a stuff of legends. Many ambitious monarchs have spent their lifetime struggling in achieving the dream of a Renovatio Imperii. With the establishment of the Holy Roman Empire, some thought that the dream of a new Renovatio Imperii has became a reality. The Holy Roman Empire has proved time and time again that it is not the answer to the Renovatio Imperii question. With our current stature, we stand at a crossroad. We can end the renovatio Imperii once and for all, or declare a new renovatio Imperii; a Francorum Renovatio Imperii."
 ME_France_Events.42.OPT1: "Release the disparate states!"
 ME_France_Events.42.OPT2: "Declare the Francorum Renovatio Imperii Romanorum!"

 ME_France_Events.43.T: "A New Dilemma"
 ME_France_Events.43.D: "Reformists are appearing in France! Reformist ideas are being spread throughout France like wildfire. These foreign preachers are converting our population and local churches are being formed that are preaching a new kind of Christianity."
 ME_France_Events.43.OPT1: "The calm before the storm."

 ME_France_Events.44.T: "The Huguenots"
 ME_France_Events.44.D: "Once a minor faction in France the Huguenots were considered as vocal heretics at best. With the ever growing popularity of the Reformation in France, the Huguenots saw their chance in gaining power and urged the peasantry to take up arms against the oppressive Catholic church and the state. We are in front of a crossroad, should we be tolerant towards this faction and anger the catholic world, or should we "forcefully" end their movement? "
 ME_France_Events.44.OPT1: "We should allow them to worship in peace."
 ME_France_Events.44.OPT2: "We can not tolerate heretics."

 ME_France_Events.45.T: "The Growth of Calvinism in France."
 ME_France_Events.45.D: "With the rapid rise of the Huguenot faction in France, force conversion is not being efficient. More heretics are rising in different parts of France and continuing the work of their predecessors."
 ME_France_Events.45.OPT1: "Continue the prosecutions."

 ME_France_Events.46.T: "The Final Solution"
 ME_France_Events.46.D: "The situation is growing out of hand. Day after day more reformists are rising up in defiance to the Catholic church and the state. Perhaps a final possible solution would be to exterminate as much of them as possible, in order to put fear inside their hearts."
 ME_France_Events.46.OPT1: "Excite the people to carry out mob violence against the Huguenots."

 ME_France_Events.47.T: "Unity Through Faith"

 ME_France_Events.48.T: "The Papal Response"
 ME_France_Events.48.D: "Our policy of tolerance towards the heretics has served us well in quenching the fires of protests and riots, but the global community and the catholic world specifically has been looking at us with distrust. An envoy has arrived from the papal states, condemning us for all the actions that we have taken thus far."
 ME_France_Events.48.OPT1: "It's high time for the Pope to learn his place. We will be a bastion for all Christians alike to live in peace."

 ME_France_Events.49.T: "Unity Through Faith"
 ME_France_Events.49.D: "French stability has finally been achieved. All Christians alike are allowed to live freely inside France. Truly a bastion of Christianity that is tolerant towards all."

 ME_France_Events.51.D: "The state of Normandy, a region full of history, be it the home of William of Normandy (also known as William the Conqueror) or the site where St. Joan of Arc martyred has came back into our fold.

 ME_France_Events.52.T: "Tree-lined highways"

 ME_France_Events.53.T: "Pont Neuf"

 ME_France_Events.56.T: "The Holy Roman Question"
 ME_France_Events.56.D: "With the French region firmly under our grasp our administration can now start looking to expand outwards. To our east lies the infamous Holy Roman Empire which has been a French holding before being passed down to the Germans, who are not worthy to hold such a prestigious title because of their weak authority over the smaller princes. We should use Charlemagne's legacy as a pretex to discredit the current empire and form a true empire worthy of his legacy ourselves."
 ME_France_Events.56.OPT1: "Our forefathers will be smiling upon us"

 ME_France_Events.57.T: "hidden event"
 ME_France_Events.57.D: "hidden event"
 ME_France_Events.57.OPT1: "hidden event"

 ME_France_Events.58.T: "The Oath of Fidelity"
 ME_France_Events.58.D: "In 789, Charlemagne decreed that all the free men of his realm were required to swear an oath of loyalty to him, establishing a tradition that was a vital part of Carolingian governance and royal ideology for the next century, but with the fragmentation of the empire in the later ninth century, the oath of loyalty could no longer be administered as before. With the re-establishment of this ancient kingdom, the emperor has once again declared that every abled body must declare an oath of fidelity to him and him alone."
 ME_France_Events.58.OPT1: "We serve him with utmost loyalty"
 ME_France_Events.58.OPT2: "Our allegiance lies elsewhere"

 ME_France_Events.59.T: "[From.GetName] breaks out of the Empire"

 ME_France_Events.60.D: "Francia, a journey which was full of adversity and trial, is becoming more of a reality as the days keep passing by. Many doubted our grand ambition, but here we are standing on the ashes of those very same doubters victoriously.

 ME_France_Events.66.T: "The Provencal Claims"
 ME_France_Events.66.D: "The Dukes of Provence have proven mightily ambitious in recent years, claiming every vacant throne from Aragon to Jerusalem. When all is said and done, however, they are nothing but a mere scion of the Valois dynasty which rules France, the greatest crown in Europe outside the Emperor himself. This junior part of the family has managed to secure itself de jure French possessions far and wide, has proclaimed themselves a kingdom, and even claims as core territory land that is our own core territory! \n\nNeedless to say, the lofty ambitions of this cadet branch threaten to interfere with ours. While the Anjou princes have tried their best to maintain good relations, perhaps it is in our best interest to reconsider their alliance with us..."
 ME_France_Events.66.OPT1: "It is time that Provence acknowledges our rule"
 ME_France_Events.66.OPT2: "We shall rule them with an iron first!"

 ME_France_Events.67.T: "The Breton Question"
 ME_France_Events.67.D: "While the Bretons were included in the old Carolingian Empire, the last bastion of Celtic presence in mainland Europe was quick to regain it's independence. Gifted with deft diplomats, they negotiated our respect for their sovereignty in exchange for neutrality in the Hundred Years' War. Now that the English have been evicted from France, however, this promise of neutrality is no longer relevant. More relevant is the promise of the treaty that Brittany will swear fealty and tribute to the rightful King of France. \n\nTreaty or not, the fact remains that the Bretons occupy land that is rightfully part of the French crown. Whether we choose to act on our legal rights, however, depends on the diplomatic consequences of doing so."
 ME_France_Events.67.OPT1: "The Bretons must forfeit their throne to us!"
 ME_France_Events.67.OPT2: "Brittany is a rightful part of France!"
 ME_France_Events.67.OPT3: "We have no need of land in Brittany, if they want it they can have it."

 ME_France_Events.68.T: "Reigning over the Russians."
 ME_France_Events.68.D: "With the submition of the Russian region complete, we have finally brought the Russian bear to heel. Due to the great distance between France and Russia, administrating the region is becoming extremely difficult and many of our advisors are suggesting the formation of a de facto state that will solve this issue for us."
 ME_France_Events.68.OPT1: "Let us form a client state that will administer Russia."
 ME_France_Events.68.OPT2: "We will reign over the Russians with a fist of steel"

 ME_France_Events.69.T: "Reigning over the British"
 ME_France_Events.69.D: "With our acquisition of the British Isles, we have cemented our mercantile superiority over Europe. Administering this land however, is a different task. We can establish a puppet state which will quench all fires of revolution in these lands, or we can directly control these lands in the expense of higher rates of protests."
 ME_France_Events.69.OPT1: "Let us form a client state that will administer the British Isles."
 ME_France_Events.69.OPT2: "We will reign over the British with a fist of steel"

 ME_France_Events.70.T: "The Dawn of a New World Order"
 ME_France_Events.70.D: "With our newly found supremacy in the European continent, the next logical question to be asked is "What now?"

Our men stand in line awaiting orders, our horses poised to charge and our artillery ready to roar in the battlefield. For victory belongs to the most persevering and France is infinite!"
 ME_France_Events.70.OPT1: "Impossible is a word to be found only in the dictionary of fools."

 ME_France_Events.75.OPT2: "We will not interfere"

 ME_France_Events.76.T: "Franco-Iberian Relations"
 ME_France_Events.76.D: "Our Spanish neighbors to the south have always played a big role in French foreign affairs. One important feature of those early relations was that counts from the Marca Hispanica & Navarre fought shoulder to shoulder with Frankish Kings to protect Europe from the Al Andalus Muslim kingdom during which Barcelona was a County of the Frankish Empire, under protection of the Franc Imperator. With the current situation in Catalonia and Aragon many in our council are asking for the return of the rightful French County."
 ME_France_Events.76.OPT1: "We shall take Catalonia back, with some interest."

 ME_France_Events.80.T: "How does the French HRE work?"
 ME_France_Events.80.D: "The French HRE operates somewhat close to the vanilla HRE that eu4 provides. You have §BFrench Authority§! which is accumulated yearly. The yearly tick happens in the first month of every year. §BFrench Authority§! will let you pass reforms which will be found in the decisions tab. The amount of §GPrince Français§! you have will obviously increase the amount of §BFrench Authority§! you gain per yearly tick. §GPrince Français§! act somewhat similarly to the HRE princes as in they are independent and autonomous (to an extent per PDX limitations on modding of course). At the start, every §Ovassal§! you own will be converted to a §GPrince Français§! "Whose total development is less than 100 and is located in Europe". You can get more §GPrince Français§! through war and diplomacy. There will be a peace offer which converts viable nations into §GPrince Français§! and a diplomacy button which invites nations to become §GPrince Français§!."
