 cpm_mountain_training_title: "Mountain Training"
 cpm_mountain_training_desc: "The rugged landscape of Iran spells nothing but trouble for those choosing to send their troops into our lands. We must take advantage of this as much as possible, specializing our troops to fight in the most extreme climates."
 cpm_allies_title: "Secure Our Position"
 cpm_allies_desc: "The nations of the Caspian Sea are surrounded by invaders on every side, envious of our rich trading cities. Unless we form a network of alliances, we will be a footnote in history, integrated into some less worthy power!"
 cpm_conquer_mazandaran_title: "Conquest of Mazandaran"
 cpm_conquer_mazandaran_desc: "The final pretender to the Sultanate of Mazandaran, the Afrasiyabs of Amol, are all that lie in the way of dominating the Caspian coast. Their conquest would mark the first time in centuries the Caspian Sea be unified by a local power."
 cpm_conquer_rival_title: "Crush the Pretenders"
 cpm_conquer_rival_desc: "Our rivals have claimed the area of greater Gilan for themselves, refusing to acknowledge us as the rightful ruler. Such insolence must not go unpunished!"

 cpm_army_title: "Increase the Garrisons"
 cpm_army_desc: "Being so isolated from the rest of Persia is damning of the other sultans' opinions of us. They look upon us with greed in their us, seeing us as just another province to conquer. We must remain vigilant, ready for an invasion at all times."

Workshops are a must if we're to keep up."
 cpm_develop_rasht_title: "The Gate of Europe"
