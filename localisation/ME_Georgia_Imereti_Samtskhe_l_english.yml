 GEO_bastion_title: "Protect Georgian Orthodoxy"
 GEO_bastion_desc: "Within the incredibly diverse greater Caucasus, there are kingdoms and principalities of many religions and cultures. However, most of these lands have been conquered and settled by Muslim Turcomans and hordes who threaten the authority of the patriarchy. The Georgian Church currently stands alone in our devotion to Christ with vile heathens and heretics on most of our long borders. The chaotic struggle with the Muslims will be endless, but we can at least protect Georgian Orthodoxy within our domain."
 GEO_combat_the_collapse_title: "Combat the Collapse"
 GEO_combat_the_collapse_desc: "Our nation is in a precarious state. Our splintered kingdom is a fraction the size and even less stable than when united, and all lands west of Kartli-Kakheti and Tbilisi have seceded from our realm. The armies have lost all loyalty to our kingdom and have defected to our rebellious generals. It will take a miracle to restore us now. Fortunately, we have such miracles in throves."
 GEO_quell_the_atabegate_title: "Quell the Atabegate"
 GEO_quell_the_atabegate_desc: "For decades, the Atabegate of Samtskhe has been extremely autonomous within our realm. However, they have simply taken it too far with their illegal seccession from the union. In order to protect the fragile union of Georgia, it is imperative we subdue the autonomous principality and restore our rule in the region."
 GEO_noble_peasantry_title: "Noble Peasantry"
 GEO_noble_peasantry_desc: "Whilst it sounds like an absurd oxymoron, it is entirely possibly. The peasanttry make up a majority of the population, yet have no influence in the aristocratic nobility. Even with the collapse of the crown, our nation still has filled coffers, boundless amounts of cash lying in our treasuries. Using this, we can enlist the peasants in our armies and use the tenacious peasants to fight for our cause.."
 GEO_the_mountain_men_title: "The Mountain Men"
 GEO_the_mountain_men_desc: "Men of Caucasia, hardened by life on the mountains, show resiliance in the face of battle, nobility in the face of slaughter, and valor in the face of death. No man of Georgia shall meet death without first spitting in its face."
 GEO_militarized_state_title: "Militarized State"
 GEO_militarized_state_desc: "The Georgian nation is renowned for its incredible soldiers, but the state of the military arises from the core of Georgian culture. We are a people of the pikem and we shall show the world that it is we who possess the greatest will."
 GEO_tbilisi_of_merchants_title: "Merchants of Tbilisi"
 GEO_tbilisi_of_merchants_desc: "Tbilisi has been the center of the Georgian kingdom for centuries. As such, it is a prosperous urban center and one of the largest in the greater Caucasus, but the years have been harsh. With the decline of Georgia the city declined just as much, losing importance to cities like Diyarbekir or Qirim. Regional commerce has decreased by alarming amounts and merchants no longer visit the city. We should start development projects and expand the infrastructure of Tbilisi in order to combat the absence of commerce."
 GEO_strengthen_the_state_title: "Stabilize the State"
 GEO_strengthen_the_state_desc: "Since the beginning of the decline of Georgia and the dissolution of the Georgian union, the legitimacy of our crown has been tarnished and our nation is extremely unstable. One of our key priorities in order to end the rapid deterioration of our kingdom is to restabilize and make our nation have a legitimate claim to throne, so that pretenders shall never threaten our authority again."
 GEO_crossroads_of_caucasia_title: "Crossroads of Caucasia"
 GEO_crossroads_of_caucasia_desc: "Our position nestled within the mountains of the greater Caucasus is both a blessing and a curse. Whilst the mountains defend us from foreign invasions, they also render us economically unstable. Not only do limited people live within our nation because of the harsh terrain, the excess of mountainous land and the lack of arable forces us to import food from foreign nations Even with reform and increased taxes, the people are discontent, starving, and the economy in shambles with a looming bankruptcy in the near future. It is imperative we focus on the mercantile affairs of Georgia before we experience an economic recession and inevitable bankruptcy."
 GEO_georgian_renaissance_title: "Georgian Renaissance"
 GEO_georgian_renaissance_desc: "Whilst the westerners undergo a cultural rebirth - more widely referred to as the Renaissance - Georgia falls behind tremendously. We have been more preoccupied with reuniting our kingdom and ending the decline than ushering in a golden age of art and culture; the golden age of Georgian culture has long passed, and we are not on the path to another one just yet. Now that Georgia is reunited, we can focus on allowing art and culture to experience a rebirth of our own - the Georgian Renaissance."
 GEO_imereti_campaign_title: "Imeretian Campaign"
 GEO_imereti_campaign_desc: "With the weakening of the authority of the Georgian crown, pretenders in Imereti seized our coastal holdings and seceded from our realm. Now that we have a more competent ruler who will not embezzle our economy to shambles and turn our armies loyal to rebellious generals and oppose us, we can seek to reconquer our lost lands in Imereti."
 GEO_beauty_tis_nigh_title: "Unite the Circassians"
 GEO_beauty_tis_nigh_desc: "The disunited petty tribes of Circassia are under threat from the Genoan merchant republic, the weak Crimean khanate, and the so-called 'Great' Horde. Nevertheless, the Circassians refuse to pledge their loyalty to our great nation, even though we are brothers in faith, similar in culture, and have offered to appeal to their needs. Since they have rejected our proposal for diplomatic subjugation, we must use brute force to overrun them. It no longer matters that they are brothers in faith, we must conquer them in order to protect them for the years to come."
 GEO_peninsular_advance_title: "Peninsular Advance"
 GEO_peninsular_advance_desc: "A newly established state, the Crimeans are already in the midst of a succession crisis that has forced them to appeal to the Turks of Constantinople for help. If Crimea becomes subject to the Ottoman crown, the Black Sea and surrounding regions will ultimately fall under their sphere of influence, including us. As Georgia will become one step closer to Turkish domination in this manner, we must to seize Crimea and prevent Turkish supremacy in the Black Sea."
 GEO_georgia_united_title: "Georgia United"
 GEO_georgia_united_desc: "For the last century, Georgia was embroiled in a civil war and was spiraling into rapid decline. Thanks to the military, administrative, and diplomatic might of our great leader, we have managed to reverse the seemingly irreversible fracturing of the Georgian state. In just a matter of years, we have united the myriad principalities and reconsolidated Georgian authority in the greater Caucasus."
 GEO_gateway_to_caspian_title: "Gateway to the Caspian"
 GEO_gateway_to_caspian_desc: "The Caspian Sea is a hub of trade where many small kingdoms intertrade and goods can travel from the northern hordes to Tabarestan without traversing the inhospitable conditions of the Caucasus. However, the Shirvanshahs of Azerbaijan currently stand in the way between our nation and prevent us from accesssing the Caspian Sea. Long ago, during the 12th century, Shirvan was a dominion of Georgia under David IV, but has been lost to the Shirvanshahs for some centuries now. We should reconquer our lost lands in Shirvan and gain access to the lucrative Caspian sea trade. "
 GEO_of_the_shamakalate_title: "Of the Shamkhalate"
 GEO_of_the_shamakalate_desc: "Dagestan has long been a haven of the rival Gazikumukh Shamkhalate. They continously propagate Islam among the Caucasus and directly contribute to the decline of Orthodoxy and its receding to the steppes of Circassia and the mountains of Georgia. For no longer shall the Shamkhalate oppose our dominance in the Caucasus and convert our brethren away from the true faith! "
 GEO_bring_forth_prosperity_title: "Bring Forth Prosperity"
 GEO_bring_forth_prosperity_desc: "Because we have been too focused on domestic political struggles, we have neglected our conquered territories and they have become relatively autonomous and discontent. All lands of our realm are ours to rule, and our responsibility from here on henceforth. Our Azerbaijani subjects, remnants of the Shirvanshahs that we subdued, are extremely disregarded and carry a heavy burden on their shoulders. As their overlords, we must ensure their prosperity for centuries to come."
 IME_georgia_campaign_title: "Seize Tbilisi"
 IME_georgia_campaign_desc: "We have finally been freed from the tyrannical rule of the Kartli-Kakheti branch of the Bagrationi dynasty and have consolidated our rule in Imereti and the coast. However, Tbilisi, the coveted administrative and cultural capital of Georgia, is still under their rule. It is said that the rulers of Tbilisi are to become the rulers of Georgia, but the senior Bagrationi are clearly no longer controllers of a united Georgia. Instead, we should subjugate Tbilisi and gain legitimate claim of the title of ruler of Georgia."
 IME_quell_the_atabegate_title: "Subdue the Atabegate"
 IME_quell_the_atabegate_desc: "For decades, the trivial Atabegate of Samtskhe to our south has been extremely autonomous within the Georgian realm. The troublesome Atabegate has laid claim to Guria and calls it their rightful territory. Now that both we and them have seceded from the Georgian realm, we are no longer forced to cooperate with them. Thanks to this, we can finally end this decades-long struggle between our nation and theirs by eliminating them from the face of the Earth."
 SME_vile_imereti_title: "Vile Imereti"
 SME_vile_imereti_desc: "There has always been an intense rivalry between our Atabegate and the Imeretian branch of the Bagrationi dynasty. On the fracturing of the Georgian realm, the vile Imeretians seized our core lands in Guria and left us locked to the mountains. Now that both nations are free from the Georgian shackle, however, we can take advantage of this opportunity, invade Imereti, and restore our former domain."
 SME_wicked_tbilisi_title: "Secure Tbilisi"
 SME_wicked_tbilisi_desc: "Tbilisi has for long been the center of Georgian culture and religion and the capital of the senior branch of the Bagrationi dynasty. With the union between Kartli-Kakheti, Imereti, and Samtskhe dissolved, the Bagrationi dynasty has been reduced to outposts in Kartli-Kakheti and the Georgian center at Tbilisi, a shadow of their former selves and weaker than ever. It has long been said that the rulers of Tbilisi have legitimate claim to all of Georgia, so if we truly want to unite Georgia under our rule, we must seize Tbilisi and make it our own."
