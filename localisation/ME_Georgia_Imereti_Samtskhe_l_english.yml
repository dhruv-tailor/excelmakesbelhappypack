 # Missions:
 GEO_bastion_title: "A Bastion, Alone"
 GEO_bastion_desc: "The Georgian Church stands alone in our devotion to Christ in these horrid mountains. Heathens and heretics lurk around every corner. We certainly cannot abandon our grand faith, thus we must take measures to ensure the flourishment of Orthodox Christianity within our borders."
 GEO_combat_the_collapse_title: "Combat the Collapse"
 GEO_combat_the_collapse_desc: "The Georgian state stands in great peril. The splintered status of our kingdom only compounds the fact that we have utterly lost control over our northern territories. It will take a miracle to restore us now. Fortunately, we have such miracles in throves."
 GEO_quell_the_atabegate_title: "Quell the Atabegate"
 GEO_quell_the_atabegate_desc: "Samtskhe's illegal seccession from the union shan't be tolerated. Such acts of pure disrepsect shall be met with bloodshed and terror. Their end shall be swift."
 GEO_noble_peasantry_title: "Noble Peasantry"
 GEO_noble_peasantry_desc: "An oxymoron to say the least. Our kingdom was once the object of all envy, our treasury bursting at the seams. We must draw upon this beauty, this nostalgia, to bring forth a swarm of tenacious peasants to bring about our will."
 GEO_the_mountain_men_title: "The Mountain Men"
 GEO_the_mountain_men_desc: "Men of Caucasia, hardened by life on the mountains, show resiliance in the face of battle, nobility in the face of slaughter, and valor in the face of death. No man of Georgia shall meet death without first spitting in its face."
 GEO_militarized_state_title: "Militarized State"
 GEO_militarized_state_desc: "The Georgian nation is renowned for its incredible soldiers, but the state of the military arises from the core of Georgian culture. We are a people of the pikem and we shall show the world that it is we who possess the greatest will."
 GEO_tbilisi_of_merchants_title: "Tbilisi of Merchants"
 GEO_tbilisi_of_merchants_desc: "The city of Tbilisi has been our capital for centuries. Such a development has spurred commerce within its walls, but it could be so much more. If we merely invested in its infrastructure, we could ensure that it remained on the path of passing merchants."
 GEO_strengthen_the_state_title: "Strengthen the State"
 GEO_strengthen_the_state_desc: "Georgia must stand tall, above all other Caucasian kingdoms. This task requires a certain measure of preparation, but allocation of state resources should do the trick."
 GEO_crossroads_of_caucasia_title: "Crossroads of Caucasia"
 GEO_crossroads_of_caucasia_desc: "All who wish to traverse Caucasia must first pass through our borders. Despite our valuable positioning, the economy still lies in shambles, barely held together by reform and tax. We should focus more on the mercantile affairs of Georgia."
 GEO_georgian_renaissance_title: "Georgian Renaissance"
 GEO_georgian_renaissance_desc: "As Europe undergoes a cultural rebirth, we sit on our hands, awaiting a triumph that may never arrive. No more. We shall grab our culture by the neck and shake its feathers off."
 GEO_imereti_campaign_title: "Imereti Campaign"
 GEO_imereti_campaign_desc: "The false kingdom of Imereti cannot be tolerated. It is merely a splinter led by a pretender, nothing more. We will reverse our fall, no matter what. Demetre I knows no heir, thus tact might be the solution. Our options are truly plentiful."
 GEO_beauty_tis_nigh_title: "Beauty 'tis Nigh"
 GEO_beauty_tis_nigh_desc: "The Circassians refuse to pledge their loyalty to our grand cause. In the face of such rejection, our spirits are merely tempered, not broken. Our only regret it to spill the blood of our fellow devotees of the Lord."
 GEO_peninsular_advance_title: "Peninsular Advance"
 GEO_peninsular_advance_desc: "The Crimeans are in the midst of a succession crisis that could spell the downfall of their state. It would be a mercy to the people of Crimea to secure the peninsula whilst they still live in relative prosperity."
 GEO_georgia_united_title: "Georgia United"
 GEO_georgia_united_desc: "We have reversed the inevitable collapse of the Georgian State to preserve the Georgian people. Our devotion and tenacity has truly paid off in full. The world now beckons."
 GEO_gateway_to_caspian_title: "Gateway to Caspian"
 GEO_gateway_to_caspian_desc: "The Caspian Sea lies straight ahead. The Shirvani state, naught but a roadblock, shall fall quickly, for it was built on chaos on strife. It lacks our unity, for Georgia shan't ever fall."
 GEO_of_the_shamakalate_title: "Of the Shamakalate"
 GEO_of_the_shamakalate_desc: "The Dagestani are a proud yet oddly tribal people. No matter, for they are our brethren beneath these mighty, imposing mountains we call our home. If we are to share a home, it is only natural to share a state... they will rejoice!"
 GEO_bring_forth_prosperity_title: "Bring Forth Prosperity"
 GEO_bring_forth_prosperity_desc: "We have neglected our conquered territories for far too long. All people of the Caucasus are ours to rule, and thus they are ours to look after. Our Shirvani subjects carry a heavy burden upon their bereaved shoulders. We must ensure their prosperity for centuries to come."
 IME_georgia_campaign_title: "Tbilisi Campaign"
 IME_georgia_campaign_desc: "The false Georgian monarch in Tbilisi cannot be tolerated. The tyranny of the Tbilisi Bagrationis cannot be bore with anymore. Georgia shall be restored under a ruler which puts life of his people before his own."
 IME_quell_the_atabegate_title: "Quell the Atabegate"
 IME_quell_the_atabegate_desc: "The Atabegate of Samtskhe must be dealt with, for their house has no claim to Georgian Kingdom. The Georgian lands were given to the Bagrationi dynasty by God, and the grant must be respected. We must end the Jaqeli menace swiftly."
 SME_vile_imereti_title: "Vile Imereti"
 SME_vile_imereti_desc: "The Imereti Bagrationi is a branch of the main stem of Georgia. These too, cannot be trusted in ruling over the Georgians. We have seceded from their rule for a reason. Imereti shall be ours!"
 SME_wicked_tbilisi_title: "Wicked Tbilisi"
 SME_wicked_tbilisi_desc: "The remnants of the old dynasty still remain ruling in the Georgian city of Tbilisi. The misdeeds of the dynasty are still valid, and we shall not tolerate their rule. It is time to succeed the Bagrationi dynasty in ruling Georgia."
