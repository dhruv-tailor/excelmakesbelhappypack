When she visited Jerusalem she brought with her 3 djinn, each of whom gave Solomon a task, only after passing all three did Solomon take the Queen as his lover, and gave birth to the greatest dynasty the world will ever know. We shall make our progenitors proud of us, as we follow in their footsteps."

These rock-hewn temples are created by selecting a large area of volcanic rock, digging straight down to create a monolith, and then chiselling the building out of the great stone block. It could be said Ethiopian Temples are in fact closer to huge sculptures than they are buildings"
