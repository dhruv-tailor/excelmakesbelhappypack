 form_swabia_title: "Reform the Duchy of Swabia"
 form_swabia_desc: "The once prestigious Duchy of [SWB.GetName] has fallen into a patchwork of squabbling repubics and baronies. We seek to unite [SWB.GetName] once again under one ruler, and when the deed is done, [SWB.GetName] will once again be a major player in German politics!"
