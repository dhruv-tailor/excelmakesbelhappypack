 feeding_the_army_using_MOL_desc: "An army marches on its stomach, but in times of war such a truth can place a heavy burden on our people, especially on the fringes of our empire where conflict is likely to take place. However, Moldavia has fertile lands and a strategic location, and it's wheat stores could feed our army for months. Our vassal will be upset, but isn't it better if the infidels make this sacrifice, rather than our own people?"

Copper, iron and silver abounds, but we have not had the capacity to extract it, and the few mining companies that exist keep the profit for themselves. By passing a law assigning exclusive mining rights only to chartered companies, these valuable metals will at last benefit us."
