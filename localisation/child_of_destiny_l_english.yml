 cod_event.1.t: "Child of Destiny"
 cod_event.1.d: "As you hold little [Root.Heir.GetName] in your arms you feel something ominous eminate from [Root.Heir.GetName]'s tiny eyes. They are not filled with the glee of a newborn babe, but with the determined ambition of a warrior... You are sure it is nothing, but the person who delivered [Root.Heir.GetName] did claim the night of [Root.Heir.GetName]'s birth unusual somehow, blessed perhaps? Although some would call it folly, you remember the night as one bearing prophecy.\n\nAs you put [Root.Heir.GetName] back to bed, a shiver runs down your spine -- in your  mind's eyes, an image of the world changing flashes past, where great kings bend the knee to your son.\n\nPerhaps it is time for you to go to bed, too."

 cod_event.4.t: "A Holy Warrior?"
 cod_event.4.d: "I had accompany [Root.Heir.GetName] to a holy place, to learn more about our faith. Upon returning, people claim that [Root.Heir.GetName] had a vision from God while praying! Apparently my son loudly proclaimed passages from there, which he had no way of knowing..."

 cod_event.5.t: "The Cunning General"

 cod_event.6.d: "My servant apparently lost track of [Root.Heir.GetName] today, and it took hours to locate!

When they found [Root.Heir.GetName], he was reading a book no one had ever seen before, written in Latin no less..."

 cod_event.7.t: "An Assassination Attempt!"

 cod_event.8.t: "A Hunting Accident?"
 cod_event.8.d: "I am awestruck when I see what my marshal and [Root.Heir.GetName] have brought back from heir hunt. A trophy from a massive bear! I thought they were hunting for rabbit...

 cod_event.8.a: "Unbelievable!"
 
 cod_event.9.t: "The Popular Child"
 cod_event.9.d: "[Root.Heir.GetName] is no mere child anymore, that much is evident. [Root.Heir.GetName] is constantly surrounded by young infatuated admirers, and he is obviously enjoying the attention!"

 cod_event.11.t: "The Great Conqueror"
 cod_event.11.d: "As the days pass by, you look at your realm, a small stone in a big river, the land where everyone thinks nothing can change, even with the greatest ambition.

A goal so enthusiastic, yet so absurd. Are you perhaps the chosen one, or are you just another mortal?"
 cod_event.11.a: "Beware world, for I am here to tame you!"
