 ME_Korea_Events.7.t: "Sejo's Coup"
 ME_Korea_Events.7.d: "The ascension of the young and inexperienced [Root.Monarch.GetName] to the throne has left two players in the court. The old and skilled regents who uphold the promises made with former king, represented by Hwangbo In and Kim Jongseo, were the last defence for the legitimate successor [Root.Monarch.GetName]. They would help young king's affairs until he could stand on his own two feet. This resulted in tension between the court and royal family members. One of the greatly angered was Sejo, one of the members of the royal family, who, determined to kick those two out of power, has decided to forge a web of alliance and conduct a coup to seize the throne for himself. Soon after his ascension to the throne, he disbanded the Hall of Worthies. His literati supporters became the Hungu faction."
 ME_Korea_Events.7.a: "And so it begins..."

 ME_Korea_Events.8.t: "A New Era"
 ME_Korea_Events.8.d: "The death of the king has shaken everyone in the court. The previous faction trembles in fear of being rejected by the new ruler and tried for their misdeeds. Who will the new ruler support though?"

 ME_Korea_Events.9.d: "Due to internal strife amongst the faction members, the Sarim factions has split into two. Those who favor the absolute government call themselves the east and the aristocratic idealists call themselves the west. Their debates dominate the topic of everyday conversations and are in mouth of every scholar. In such environment, the Hungu factions fades to obscurity paving the way for a new factional split. The era of East versus the West has begun."
 ME_Korea_Events.9.a: "Support the West"
 ME_Korea_Events.9.b: "Support the East"

 ME_Korea_Events.11.t: "New Reforms"
 ME_Korea_Events.11.d: "The ruling faction has suggested a bunch of reforms aiming to implement their agenda. After further examination, the changes have been deemed an absolute positive and implemented."
 ME_Korea_Events.11.a: "Fantastic News!"

 ME_Korea_Events.12.t: "Diminishing Authority"
 ME_Korea_Events.12.d: "The reforms suggested by the current faction are threatening the authority of the royalty. Such reforms would be not only controversial, but also harmful to us. However, they would also improve the status of the country. Shall we proceed?"
 ME_Korea_Events.12.a: "Proceed with the reforms"
 ME_Korea_Events.12.b: "Veto! Authority is key."

 ME_Korea_Events.13.t: "Radical Reforms"
 ME_Korea_Events.13.d: "Ruling faction, although acting for the greater good, is aiming to implement reforms of such radicality, that they would greatly destabilize our country. Surely, implementing the reforms would be beneficial, but is it worth the cost?"
 ME_Korea_Events.13.a: "Let us Proceed."
 ME_Korea_Events.13.b: "To destabilize the country is to ruin it from within. No reforms!"

 ME_Korea_Events.14.t: "Military Opposition"
 ME_Korea_Events.14.d: "The benevolent reforms proposed by the scholars of the current faction are striving towards improving the state of the country. However, these reforms indirectly conflict with the interests of our General Staff. Should we implement the reforms, a large portion of officers will resign."
 ME_Korea_Events.14.a: "Clearly, the generals are not fit for their job anyway"
 ME_Korea_Events.14.b: "We need them!"

 ME_Korea_Events.15.t: "Reforms threaten General Staff"
 ME_Korea_Events.15.d: "Unfortunately, the new reforms, despite being innovative in nature, are putting a strain on our research. If implemented, they will jeopardize our research until it stabilizes few years after."
 ME_Korea_Events.15.a: "Reforms lead to progress!"
 ME_Korea_Events.15.b: "We can't afford this, even if short term."

 ME_Korea_Events.16.t: "Reforms alter Hyang'yak"
 ME_Korea_Events.16.d: "The Hyang'yak allows for a degree of local governments. The autonomy of Hyang'yak has allowed the agrarian economy to flourish and the local governments to administer properly. Unfortunately, the new reforms being implemented by the factions would impede that delicate balance."
 ME_Korea_Events.16.a: "No progress without struggle."
 ME_Korea_Events.16.b: "The Hyangyak is sacred!"

 ME_Korea_Events.17.t: "A Great Philosopher"
 ME_Korea_Events.17.d: "Once in a while, a great philosopher is born. If the talent is properly assessed and the philosopher starts making breakthroughs, he is carefully examined and praised for his work. Once one's fame grows large enough, the King would grant his own signature to the regional Seowon. It was a great honor to gain such signature, and as such it is notoriously used for bragging. Now, with one of the praised philosophers gaining tractions, what should be done?"
 ME_Korea_Events.17.a: "Grant Glorious Name!"
 ME_Korea_Events.17.b: "No special favors!"
 
 ME_Korea_Events.18.t: "Left Right Unite"
 ME_Korea_Events.18.d: "The Factions, notorious for constantly being at odds with each other, are not all that bad as the word of mouth makes it out to be. Factions, albeit hostile to each other, are ready to unite for the greater good. We are blessed to witness such unity happen right before our eyes, as the factions are united and passing an urgent reform!"
 ME_Korea_Events.18.a: "At least they could agree for once!"

 ME_Korea_Events.19.t: "A Nobi Scholar"
 ME_Korea_Events.19.d: "The ever-growing academy of Syeongkyunkwan has begun to lack servants that would serve there. As such, there has been a spike in Nobi servants, which would begin to read and write as a result of the spike in private education. Among those, one bright would begin to aim for the stars. That nobi would come to study and master the knowledge of confucianism and would begin to teach the students on his own."
 ME_Korea_Events.19.a: "An example to follow"
 ME_Korea_Events.19.b: "A Nobi he is, a scholar he cannot be"

 ME_Korea_Events.20.t: "Axe Appeal"
 ME_Korea_Events.20.d: "In the constant stream of issues that reach King everyday, it is difficult for one to hear out everybody's opinion and make well-weighted decisions at the same time. But sometimes, some scholars are desparate enough to have their opinions heard, so they have the audacity to do the Jibusangso, the axe appeal. Having placed an axe besides them, the scholar cries out for the king to hear out his opinions or to cut his head off."
 ME_Korea_Events.20.a: "Satisfy him."
 ME_Korea_Events.20.b: "Much unnecessary drama for petty reasons!"
 ME_Korea_Events.20.c: "He wants his head cut off?"

 ME_Korea_Events.21.t: "Mass Appeal"
 ME_Korea_Events.21.d: "It is approaching evening as you go out of your palace after a long discussion with your literatis on the current state of affairs within the nation. You end the meeting, thank everyone for coming, open the door, and once you cross the threshold, you are greeted by a dozen or so literatis, all on their knees before you. Suddenly, one of them, most likely their leader, raises his head and murmurs 'Your Majesty, please reconsider.' Once he has said his line, the crowd reiterates the statement indefinitely."
 ME_Korea_Events.21.a: "I will reconsider, just cease!"
 ME_Korea_Events.21.b: "Stand up, you are making this very awkward."

 ME_Korea_Events.22.t: "University Strike"
 ME_Korea_Events.22.d: "It is heavenly duty of students to pursue knowledge. However, even the most vigorous pupils are ready to disregard that, should they believe they are acting for the greater good. As such, the overwhelming majority of students of Syeongkyunkwan has decided to band together and refused to participate in lectures, so as to come and protest the recent changes mandated by [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 ME_Korea_Events.22.a: "Well, they do have a point..."
 ME_Korea_Events.22.b: "They clearly haven't been taught enough!"

 ME_Korea_Events.23.t: "Intrigue in the Court"
 ME_Korea_Events.23.d: "Rumors be, that there is a conspiracy brewing against the King. Of course, to conspire against the King is an action of extreme risk, so it is unlikely that the rumors are indeed true. However, should they be true, the royal authority is in real danger. Must action be taken in accordance to dealing with the gossips?"
 ME_Korea_Events.23.a: "Purge the Rot!"
 ME_Korea_Events.23.b: "It's all just saying."

 ME_Korea_Events.24.t: "Reforms bring Prosperity"
 ME_Korea_Events.24.d: "Proper management of the economy and the invaluable input of the factions has lead to reforms, that make the kingdom prosper like never before."
 ME_Korea_Events.24.a: "What a time to be alive!"

 ME_Korea_Events.25.t: "An Entertaining Debate"
 ME_Korea_Events.25.d: "The scholarly environment the confucianist culture brings us has lead to a grand debate among the scholars of rivalry factions. The debate has lasted for much of the day and has had many fascinating points brought up. The opposing side always gave shrewd responses and lead to logical conclusions. To say that it has influenced the King is an understatement."
 ME_Korea_Events.25.a: "Fascinating!"

 ME_Korea_Events.26.t: "Hostility between Factions Growing"
 ME_Korea_Events.26.d: "The Factions, infamous for their constant conflicts, are at it again. The past few days have been of high tension within the royal palace. Some of the literatis have been discovered bringing bladed weaponry into the debates. While these cases happen from time to time, the spike in discoveries is a bad omen."
 ME_Korea_Events.26.a: "Try to mend the situation!"

 ME_Korea_Events.27.t: "Split in the Faction"
 ME_Korea_Events.27.d: "It is only natural, that factions undergo changes with time. As such, as a result of one of the debates held within the ruling faction, two sides emerged, one supporting the conservative approach, the latter, more radical, supporting new policies that would alter many ideals. The split has greatly weakened the faction and [Root.Monarch.GetName] needs to support one of the sides."
 ME_Korea_Events.27.a: "It's the nature of time, that the old ways must give in."
 ME_Korea_Events.27.b: "The Tradition must be upheld!"

 ME_Korea_Events.28.t: "Palace Expansion"
 ME_Korea_Events.28.d: "The royal palace is visual representation of the royal power. The more grander it gets, the more authority the king seems to have. [Root.Monarch.GetName], keep in mind, the palace is already great enough. It needs not be expanded, only forbidden palace is larger than it! Compulsory expansion will cost valuable funds, that could be used in funding the military instead. Maybe the tax could be lowered to appease the commons?"
 ME_Korea_Events.28.a: "It shall be more glorious than ever!"
 ME_Korea_Events.28.b: "Maybe you're right."

 ME_Korea_Events.29.t: "Gumgye Crisis"
 ME_Korea_Events.29.d: "Marginalization and inability to succeed in life has for centuries been bringing people to the criminal ways. As such, a violent organization called 'Gumgye' has sprung up, spreading organized crime across the country. They have been terrorizing the country for the longest times. However, the secret service says that the some of the bureaucrats are paying them to attack the opposing faction. That explains the recent unsolved crimes. The evidence is substantial, and it is enough to persecute the corrupt court."
 ME_Korea_Events.29.a: "The crimes are unsolved, okay?"
 ME_Korea_Events.29.b: "Rot shall be purged."

 ME_Korea_Events.30.t: "Jobo Leak"
 ME_Korea_Events.30.d: "Jobo is the governmental press that carries news of the state. Seldom it even has confidential information, not to be shared with anybody unauthorized. Few days past, a diplomat came into the court to discuss a new trade quota. After some time and some carousing, the diplomat spilled our recent military information while drunk. It is clear that they shouldn't have known about such information. As such, you gather up all the people capable of leaking the plans. One of the new bureaucrats stands up and accuses his superior of leaking it. They belong to different factions, however the freshman claims he has strong evidence for it."
 ME_Korea_Events.30.a: "Lead an in-depth investigation"
 ME_Korea_Events.30.b: "I like his claims!"

 ME_Korea_Events.31.t: "Oligopoly of Rice"
 ME_Korea_Events.31.d: "Rice is most definitely the most important crop within all of Asia. Due to the crop's high yield and efficiency, people in the region are supporters of physiocracy. However, playing the wrong game with the crop would lead to a disaster on an unprecedented scale. Being so profitable, many people have been attracted by the possibility of multiplying their wealth. As such, many bureaucrats have gotten involved with an oligopoly of rice in the capital area. Of course, the commons are greatly upset with this state of affairs. What should be done about the oligopoly?"
 ME_Korea_Events.31.a: "Cut down on the Oligopoly"
 ME_Korea_Events.31.b: "Turn a blind eye"

 ME_Korea_Events.32.t: "Heung-Cheong"
 ME_Korea_Events.32.d: "Under the autocratic nature of the king's rule, it was his right to flirt with any girl he wanted to. Furthermore, all monarchs were capable of understanding that going too far in that regard would result in a horrendous scandal. This king, however... this king crossed the line by a mile. Using the king’s might, he conscripted the pretty girls from all over the country. In exchange, they and their families were given many favors, such as tax exemptions. The favors of course... the favors would come to drive the treasury empty. By the way, over 1000 girls? In the palace where Hall of Worthies lied?"
 ME_Korea_Events.32.a: "This is one peculiar king"

 ME_Korea_Events.33.t: "Pledge of Allegiance"
 ME_Korea_Events.33.d: "It is responsibility of a bureaucrat to remonstrate with the king, even if it might cost his life. Bureaucrats' complaints must be heard thoroughly and carefully. This cultural tradition is what Korean Government relies on. Noone would dare to break the harmony of the system until [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Yesterday, the wild, irrational, emotional king has decided to execute one of the ministers, who was administering the internal affairs. Today, you commanded all of the bureaucrats to wear cloth with written 'Absolute' on the front and 'Loyalty' on the back."
 ME_Korea_Events.33.a: "Ministers will stay absolutely loyal for sure."

 ME_Korea_Events.34.t: "Closure of University"
 ME_Korea_Events.34.d: "My majesty, I understand that you are paranoid with the recent strikes and protests directed from the young scholars of Syeongkyunkwan. I also understand and tolerate your decision not to study how to rule the country. I realize you want to go out hunting. But are you really going to close down Syeongkyunkwan, the main educational institution in the capital? Are you really going to make it into your own personal playground? ... Damn it."
 ME_Korea_Events.34.a: "He is clearly wise enough!"

 ME_Korea_Events.35.t: "Nobi Drilling"
 ME_Korea_Events.35.d: "Joseon dynasty has been born as a result of a coup instructed by general Yi Seonggye. To prevent anyone from doing likewise, an effort to institute heavy centralization has been instructed. As such, currently it is forbidden for anyone but King to have armed forces. Law dictates, that people with personal militaries are to be punished for treason. Recently, word has reached you that nobles are training their nobies to arms in the vicinity of the capital. The nobles claim it is to uphold the tradition and to research new military tactics."
 ME_Korea_Events.35.a: "The nobles are not so noble after all..."
 ME_Korea_Events.35.b: "I trust my nobles to the brim!"

 ME_Korea_Events.36.t: "Literati Purge"
 ME_Korea_Events.36.d: "The Bureaucrat responsible for writing down the annals of Joseon Dynasty has put down insults on the ruler's name. The King, discretely observing the new scriptures, has spotted the treason. The King has opted out of scolding the bureaucrat privately or ignoring him, and has instead publicly accused him of blasphemy and killed his faction. Intriguing, as the King is forbidden to look into annals by himself."
 ME_Korea_Events.36.a: "Purge the literatis to avoid rebellion."
 ME_Korea_Events.36.b: "I am the King!"

 ME_Korea_Events.37.t: "Support of Heir"
 ME_Korea_Events.37.d: "It is only natural that with the passing of time and aging of the heir, the support for the heir among the courtiers rises. But this case is different, as never has the Joseon dynasty seen the support for heir that large. It is completely valid to think to think, that there is a conspiracy to replace the [Root.Monarch.GetName] with their heir."
 ME_Korea_Events.37.a: "Purge the faction and isolate my son!"
 ME_Korea_Events.37.b: "This is a good sign!"

 ME_Korea_Events.38.t: "Rebellion!"
 ME_Korea_Events.38.d: "The inaction of [Root.Monarch.GetName] regarding the growing conspiracy has lead to the calamity of a rebellion. The rebels are clear in their intentions, they want to end the rule of the [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 ME_Korea_Events.38.a: "I will show them who is the king!"
 ME_Korea_Events.38.b: "Let us negotiate."

 ME_Korea_Events.500.t: "Westology"
 ME_Korea_Events.500.d: "The contact with the western civilization was series of surprise for us. Over time, we believed there is no other civilized world than the Confucianism cosmovision. But we were wrong. The people we've met just now seems to believe the things that doesn't even exist, and snobbish about the religion they believe in however, their effort to reveal the world seems pretty usuful to us. Perhaps a slight touch on their philosophy wouldn't hurt much."
 ME_Korea_Events.500.a: "Let's taste the new methods!"
 ME_Korea_Events.2.t: "Intresting Instruments"
 ME_Korea_Events.2.d: "We've tasted a small bit of the tools they brought with. It was far more intresting than we thought at the first glance. Glass lens is clearer and smoothly cut compared to ours, clockwork machinary is precise and delicate. If we study this, the technological advance could be done."
 ME_Korea_Events.2.a: "Intresting..."
 ME_Korea_Events.51.t: "Scholasticism"
 ME_Korea_Events.51.d: "The philosophy basis of theirs are pretty unfamilar from what we know about philosophy. Unlike Intuitionistic-empiricism based theory, they are more obsessed with the intellectualism-noetics. The surface of the philosophy don't really appeal to us, but the core concept seems valuable."
 ME_Korea_Events.51.a: "Heresy!"
 ME_Korea_Events.51.b: "Gather, people. Time to translate."
 ME_Korea_Events.52.t: "Big Guns?"
 ME_Korea_Events.52.d: "Since the adaptation of the firearms, the debate on the size of the caliber was always the hot potato. Small but many guns could swipe massive army or block the fast-approaching enemy cavarly from crashing into ranks. Big guns on the other hand, could be used to break enemy forts or ships. Handful of grapeshot could work same as many small guns, but costly. Today, the western people gave us the new methods to use big guns. The bouncing cannonball and larger muzzles are effective against all the known enemy. Adapting this will benefit greatly, but it will cost more budget."
 ME_Korea_Events.52.a: "Current guns works fine. We have a tight budget."
 ME_Korea_Events.52.b: "My Guns, Very VERY LARGE!"
 ME_Korea_Events.53.t: "Finance System"
 ME_Korea_Events.53.d: "Since the fall of the Yuan, the commerce fell sharply. Internal trade by Bobusang and river merchants were the last line of defense for maintaining the commerce tradition. With the small scale of the commerce, the need for the loan beyond solvency wasn't needed that much. However, to make economy larger, finance system must be implemented. But there are voices saying it is too risky to apply system. If the economy get's too large, it could bring the bubble in the currency value, losing the control of the economy and cause fatal inflation."
 ME_Korea_Events.53.a: "Stability of the people is important."
 ME_Korea_Events.53.b: "It's a risk to take."
 ME_Korea_Events.54.t: "Western Engineering"
 ME_Korea_Events.54.d: "See the High buildings they've made? The big ship that sails across the sea? How about Multi-angled stronghold? Their strong engineering technology could benefit our building technique and infrastructures. But with the material we have, it could cost more than the expectation. We are short of the soft dirt to make bricks, and have abundant amount of granites."
 ME_Korea_Events.54.a: "We have no need of multi-story building."
 ME_Korea_Events.54.b: "Costly, but our future lies in the engineering."
 ME_Korea_Events.55.t: "Organizing the Military"
 ME_Korea_Events.55.d: "Our military system is the variation of the Tang's military system. Although it's from ancient dynasty, it was the masterpiece for integrating all the military tactics and system that existed around the empire. That was the reason why the basic idea survived throughout the Song-Yuan-Ming dynasty. But time for the change has come. Western countries seem to have more effective way for commanding the army. But it's not familiar to us. If it is adopted, we have to rebuild our traditions from the scratch."
 ME_Korea_Events.55.a: "We can't risk the abandonment."
 ME_Korea_Events.55.b: "Risk it. Dark times are ahead of us."
 ME_Korea_Events.56.t: "Western Technology"
 ME_Korea_Events.56.d: "We've tasted the intresting instruments from the western people. It was exotic and attractive items. But it comes to mind, the cost of the fascinating products are kind of overvalued since it only came from the western merchants. The price is their call, and is steadly climbing each time when the ports are opened. The monopoly is causing rip-off of the products they bring in. It could be stopped when we embrace their technology. But there is other solution. By placing slight tariff, we can compensate the loss from the trade."
 ME_Korea_Events.56.a: "Tariff could work. We also rip them for china by the way."
 ME_Korea_Events.56.b: "Renovate the technology. Time to reshape things"
 ME_Korea_Events.57.t: "Dig Deep into the Philosophy"
 ME_Korea_Events.57.d: "After all the things we've met from the western people, we have seem to meet the obstacle. The mathmatics and machinary could be handled on our own, but we can't make new methods by ourselves. Some say this is just the nature difference, just like the crops that don't fit in different lands. But others say it's just the lack of the understanding of the philosophy of theirs."
 ME_Korea_Events.57.a: "What did you expect? Rice growing on the desert?"
 ME_Korea_Events.57.b: "There is something we're missing."
 ME_Korea_Events.58.t: "Silhak"
 ME_Korea_Events.58.d: "After studing the western knowledge, we've came to a conclusion that we've been searching in wrong area. The intuitionistic method to understand the idea wasn't the answer. We must think like them, focused more on the realistical things."
 ME_Korea_Events.58.a: "So we name this method as Silhak."
 ME_Korea_Events.58581.t: "Keep the Old Ways"
 ME_Korea_Events.58581.d: "How many times did the cult's words were right? None as the history recalls. The wicked words permeate among the people, making them rely on the illusionary belief that the new world will come by the so called SAVIOR. It mostly ended with the heavy revolts followed by the devastation of the rich lands. We've experienced it, foresaw it. That future must be prevented by following the Confucianism teachings."
 ME_Korea_Events.58581.a: "The Whisperer of the Disaster, BEGONE!"
 
 #Phase 2-1
 
 ME_Korea_Events.59.t: "Volunteerary Believers"
 ME_Korea_Events.59.d: "[Root.GetKorCatholicBelievers]"
 ME_Korea_Events.59.a: "Dear father...."
 ME_Korea_Events.60.t: "Faith Spreads"
 ME_Korea_Events.60.d: "Recently, the new religion is spreading among the people, regardless of the nolbe or the commons. It does seem not that heretic or rebellious like the colored turbans in the chinese history, but it is spreading like wildfire. The new religion is now in infantile state, but when it is left open, it is just matter of time for growing into big giant."
 ME_Korea_Events.60.a: "Cut the buds."
 ME_Korea_Events.60.b: "It's fine as long as they doesn't directly violate Confucianism."
 ME_Korea_Events.61.t: "The Miracle in the Far-East"
 ME_Korea_Events.61.d: "The heretics are ruining the Europe's Christianity. The church built upon Saint Peter's grave is losing power. The secular world is gradually overpowering confessional world. It seems obvious that the word of the God will become vague echo in the end. However, the news from the far-east diocese flew into the pope's ears\nThere were many people volunteered to believe in the faith of the Christianity, without the missionary sent. Although they violated the church law by assigning the Bishop and the priests by themselves, it was a mistake by ignorance. Now they are asking a priests to guide them. With this chance, it could be used to regain the prestige of the Church."
 ME_Korea_Events.61.a: "A Miracle Indeed!"
 ME_Korea_Events.62.t: "Question of Ancestral Ritual"
 ME_Korea_Events.62.d: "We've sent the priests to the Far-east lands, and various reports are coming in from Orders. The Jesuits who mostly handle the upper class reports that the rituals they conduct is reverent ritual. One of the way to remember ancestors and the heroic souls. The Dominico and Franciscan Orders, who mostly meet the low class are refuting that the ritual is obsence and more pagan. The balance of the two sides are tight. It's up to the Pope's decision to choose side and end the controversy."
 ME_Korea_Events.62.a: "You are right. It's idol worships."
 ME_Korea_Events.62.b: "It is their culture. Father will understand."
 ME_Korea_Events.63.t: "Korean Catholic Gathers"
 ME_Korea_Events.63.d: "The news of the Pope banning the Ancestral Ritual quickly spread. There were small controversy about the ritual rose time to time, but the majority opinion was 'It's remembrance of the forefathers'. But the with the Pope's proclamation, they would have to choose whether to be beheaded for believing the cult, or appeal to someone who can persuade Pope.\nNow, people gathered outside of the Four gates of [Root.Capital] city wall. They are pleading for the help from the [Root.GetTitle]."
 ME_Korea_Events.63.a: "VOX POPULI VOX DEI."
 ME_Korea_Events.63.b: "It's too unprestigious for [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to intervene. But send high person to aid."
 ME_Korea_Events.63.c: "They are the cult."
 ME_Korea_Events.63631.t: "Shrine Burned Down"
 ME_Korea_Events.63631.d: "Since the pope banned the ritual, the Korean christians had to abandon their faith to survive. Government used soft approach for apostasy. No beheading, No torture. Just say 'I will abandon the Christianity.' and everything will be fine even if the lies are all over your face.\nHowever, some radical believer burned his family shrine and declared discontinuation of the ritual. The ritual isn't just Confucianism tradition, it was the tradition that descendes from the Goguryo era. The voice for the punishment from the all over the state is flooding."
 ME_Korea_Events.63631.a: "They are really the cult! OFF WITH HIS HEAD!"
 ME_Korea_Events.63632.t: "Cult Sends Letter to the West"
 ME_Korea_Events.63632.d: "Since the cult's preposterous action, the Christianity was banned among the people. But the faith spread continued by underground network. A few days ago, Pododaejang, a leader of National Gendarmerie reported that the attack on cult's base was successful. But sadly, he found the letter written by cult's leader, asking western countries to overthrow $COUNTRY_ADJ$ [Root.GovernmentName] and build the Christian Kingdom. This crossed the line way over."
 ME_Korea_Events.63632.a: "From now on, Every Desert Sprit Belief will be executed."
 ME_Korea_Events.64.t: "Having the Ancestral Ritual, Pope has Said it is not Sin!"
 ME_Korea_Events.64.d: "Pope made his decision to accept the Ancestral Ritual From [GetYear]. This good news is flying around the Confucianism world. With this wise decision, two sides will see each other as a cooperative partner, not the enemy to be edificated."
 ME_Korea_Events.64.a: "Could the two world become one?"
 ME_Korea_Events.65.t: "Close the Gap"
 ME_Korea_Events.65.d: "We've learned about the Western people's fatih. And numerous people of ours are starting to believe in them. It brings us a task to find a way for harmonizing different kind from our values."
 ME_Korea_Events.65.a: "We must fund the research."
 ME_Korea_Events.66.t: "Grand Embassy to the Pope"
 ME_Korea_Events.66.d: "After harmonizing the Christianity, We have come to a question of the skills of the scholars in the west. When we were analyzing The christian ideas, we had gone through several debates however, the priests they've sent us was no match for the scholars we had. It might seem as superiority of the depth, but it's too hasty conclusion. We must sail out to the west, where the great Catholic scholars live. It'll be then, we can know what is real essence of them."
 ME_Korea_Events.66.a: "All aboard!"
 ME_Korea_Events.661.t: "Unfamiliar Methods"
 ME_Korea_Events.661.d: "In the letter sent by bishop of Far-east diocese, it was written that he was exhuasted by Korean scholar's infinite question of the Catholic dogma. Starting from the existence of the God, reasons for his actions, comparing Christianity with Confucianism ideas... Even the customs of the European world were subjected for debate. Bishop tried to answer all the questions, but he was reletively young and inexperienced to match the old and veteran bureaucrats and scholars of the Far-east. When he was outmatched, they battered him mentally, extracting all the knowledge he had. Now, the Korean scholars are coming to the Saint Peter's Basilica to challenge us. Famous scholars from all over Europe is gathering at Rome to 'Greet' them.\nIn the [GetYear], horde of Korean scholars arrived at the port of Napoli. They risked to send one of the most intelligent and skilled scholars dispite of the harsh waves. After three days, The debate took in the Saint Peter's Square. The rules were simple. A deathmatch dual debate until one couldn't answer the opponent's question.\nIt was brutal and devastating. As the time passed, elite professionals fell from each side one by one, and there were brightest one left from the both side. In the end, they called for a peace. They knew this fight will never come to a conclusion or so. They shook hands and paid respect to the knowledge they had.\nNow, the Far-east knowledge gained from this event will spread to europe. Their ideas on administrating the state seems quite usuful, but could damage the stability of the state."
 ME_Korea_Events.661.a: "Their ideas are radical and heretic!"
 ME_Korea_Events.661.b: "Meritocracy, eh? Seems usuful to us."
 ME_Korea_Events.67.t: "Ambassadors From West"
 ME_Korea_Events.67.d: "Since the grand debate that took in the west, some Europe countries showed intrest on the administrative methods. They relied on the system we abandoned over half millennia ago. Now, the enlightened monarchs and the advisors are planning to embrace the administration system from us. \nConfucicus said, 'Not betray the hearts of the ones, who come forth to seeketh the enlightenment, with a cloth in his hands.' in his words. To upkeep that quote, we must invite them in our government division and give them an experience on the high-effecient administration. It is hundred times better to see for themselves, rather than listening to the lecture itself."
 ME_Korea_Events.67.a: "Welcome, students. Today, we'll learn about...."
 ME_Korea_Events.68.t: "Strange Stirring Among Scholars"
 ME_Korea_Events.68.d: "Ever since we took the western ideology as tool to advance our statecraft, new ideas for administration bloomed. From the king's authority to the basic rights of human being, a grain of sand to the world's composition. Everything is objected to question. But it seems that it got out of control. Even now, there is new school factions are forming."
 ME_Korea_Events.68.a: "Strange... We'll have to keep an eye on it."
 
 #Phase 2-2
 
 ME_Korea_Events.69.t: "Foundation of Jaebeol"
 ME_Korea_Events.69.d: "Since the industrial renovation of the state, we've chartered the produced goods to the local nobles or gentries. With the bureaucrat's well planned prediction, the production was optimezed to the maximum level. But this made the capital owners to monopolize the industry, growing into the big blob. Although we have the control over them for now, because we were funding the industry from the beginnig however, could we keep the chains that restricts their lust for profits in the near future? The middle sized merchants who don't have peerage are starting to buy genealogy from economically fallen Yangban houses already. If these things happen more often, We'll definitely lose control."
 ME_Korea_Events.69.a: "The control is getting hard..."
 ME_Korea_Events.70.t: "Question of License"
 ME_Korea_Events.70.d: "When the Yuan collapsed, the international trade followed as well. This caused hyper inflation and deflation on the economy that relied on. To prevent the catastrophic economy disaster, countries in the east strictly restricted the commerce. Only the licensed called Sijeon could put a foot in the flow of gold.\nHowever, recent news tells us that the new merchant factions that insists free trade is forming. They are supported by the who accumulated capital through chartered goods production. Some of the scholars say that's heretic for those families to intervene in the merchant matters. If we back one, the other will be angered."
 ME_Korea_Events.70.a: "Slightly Support the Sijeon. It was us who gave them rights."
 ME_Korea_Events.70.b: "Slightly favor the unlicensed. It won't hurt to lift the restriction."
 ME_Korea_Events.71.t: "Clergy Aids Sijeon"
 ME_Korea_Events.71.d: "Since the intervention took by the [Root.Monarch], the Sijeons were not satisfied with the arbitration made with the unlicensed groups. They wanted to settle the matter once and for all. Luckly, there was a clergy faction that wants to keep the old harmony. With the bureaucrats supporitng, unlicensed merchants will have to face the means to suppress them."
 ME_Korea_Events.71.a: "Clergy sides with the licenced."
 ME_Korea_Events.72.t: "Unlicensed Unites"
 ME_Korea_Events.72.d: "The mediation of the [Root.Monarch] made things uneasier for the unlicensed merchants. What they needed utmost was the strong support of the king itself, but king does not seem to intervene deeply. This made the merchants to feel anxious on their status. Without the king's support, the law breakers would have to face the power of the government on by themselves. This raised a question to form a coalition against the Sijeon alliance."
 ME_Korea_Events.72.a: "They call themselves Sasang."
 ME_Korea_Events.73.t: "The Group Fight at the Capital"
 ME_Korea_Events.73.d: "The tensions are rising among the two merchant groups. The Sijeon uses clergy's power to enforce the law, the Sasang used the favors stacked by Jaebeols to avoid the crackdown or evade punishments. This hide and seek continued for a while, until Sasang's influence on the capital grew too much to handle easily for Sijeon. This has led Sijeons to use last resort of resolving the problem, the physical means. The leaders of Sasang on the other hand, won't stand this kind of treatment. If they disregard this problem, the coalition will break apart. Leaving them at vulnerable positions to be defeated one by one. So, the gang fight happend inside the city's walls. All the personal involved are now arrested, waiting for the [Root.Monarch]'s trial."
 ME_Korea_Events.73.a: "Punish the illegal merchants."
 ME_Korea_Events.73.b: "Punish who started the fight first."
 ME_Korea_Events.73.c: "All have the fault."
 ME_Korea_Events.74.t: "Claims on the Production"
 ME_Korea_Events.74.d: "A private owned manufactory has unintentionally walked into the trouble by taking part in Sijeon-Sasang conflict. Sasang approached to this manufactory by investing huge amount of money to diversify the supply route to prepare for the upcoming trade war. However, the joint owner of this manufactory agreed to stop the supply of goods to Sasang by signing a deal to Sijeon. These two contracts were signed and was on effect almost at the same time. Both of party claims the deal, and government is stuck in the middle."
 ME_Korea_Events.74.a: "Sijeon has rights over this matter."
 ME_Korea_Events.74.b: "Sasang has rights over this matter."
 ME_Korea_Events.75.t: "Logistics Problem"
 ME_Korea_Events.75.d: "The struggle for the dominiance of commerce aggravated when the [Root.Monarch] favored one side. And the distribution network for the supply of goods were caught in flames of the conflict. Sijeon claims the Logistics must be in their favor, since they are the only legit force in the major markets. Sasang on the other hand, argues that monopolization of the distribution would make them wither. It's time for government to settle things."
 ME_Korea_Events.75.a: "Distribute first to the major cities."
 ME_Korea_Events.75.b: "Whoever calls higher gets the goods."
 ME_Korea_Events.76.t: "Rights Abused by Sijeon"
 ME_Korea_Events.76.d: "As the level of conflict grows, Sijeon tries to eradicate the Sasang's influence inside their sphere. They uses the rights granted with the license to weed out all the suspcious producers who is possible for supplying the goods to the Sasang union. This coil a tension for a riot. Would you intervene and punish the abusing merchants? Or step aside and get commission by closing the eye for few seconds?"
 ME_Korea_Events.76.a: "It's their rights to root out law breakers."
 ME_Korea_Events.76.b: "Stop this nuisance."
 ME_Korea_Events.77.t: "Sasang Breaks the Law"
 ME_Korea_Events.77.d: "As the history doesn't remember the loser, every means varying legal to illegal must be used to win the war. But the risks for using illegal methods to respond to enemy's movement is higher then the legal one. Especially when your side is on the baddy. Recently, there has been numerous reports of rebuking the violation made by Sasang. They violated not only the non-licensed commerce, but also sabotage on the enemy faction, swindle, price manipulation, etcetera... Victims for these misbehavior are calling for justice."
 ME_Korea_Events.77.a: "It's their fault to fall into trickery!"
 ME_Korea_Events.77.b: "They have crossed the line too much. Justice for all."
 ME_Korea_Events.78.t: "Collision of the Merchants"
 ME_Korea_Events.78.d: "The strife between two merchant factions has grown too much, we tried to settle things by intervening indirectly, but it hasn't done any significant resovement so far. Two factions are calling for the death of the each other. Today, the reports are coming in from all over the regions including the capital area, that the merchants are now rising up to eradicate each other. You must stop them from breaking the country."
 ME_Korea_Events.78.a: "Request for help to Sijeon"
 ME_Korea_Events.78.b: "Request for help to Sasang"
 ME_Korea_Events.79.t: "Conflict among the Merchants are Settled"
 ME_Korea_Events.79.d: "The brutal conflict is finally over. The countermeasure and victory against the last massive revolt has brought the soothing of the merchant factions. We have shown our will to a series of problems raised by merchant factions. And will annouce new edict shortly after. Hoping this could quench the recent atmospherics. [Root.GetKorMerchantStrife]"
 ME_Korea_Events.79.a: "From now on, Merchants will follow these law."
 
 #Phase 3
 
 ME_Korea_Events.80.t: "Legitimacy Problem Strikes Back"
 ME_Korea_Events.80.d: "The legitimacy of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty] family was harshly wounded when the Yi Yu(a.k.a. Sejo) took the throne for himself. During the past time, no one dared answer the question of his descendent. However, with the numerous academic factions inspired from the new ideas, the question that was tabooed to ask publicly is rising. Is it right to serve a king who killed his nephew to fulfil his lust for the power? If it is not why does he have right to dominate us?\nYou try to stop this murmur from growing into roar of the people, but it seems too late for preventing. Now the word is spreading among every bureaucrats and the topic is expressed indirectly in the Gyeongyeon through quoting the ancient event. If we don't act soon, everyone will ask question about this matter. The petty self-justify themselves by decorating with excuses, Confucicus said."
 ME_Korea_Events.80.a: "Purge whoever overstep the line."
 ME_Korea_Events.80.b: "Accept the truth."
 ME_Korea_Events.81.t: "Reasons for Factionalism"
 ME_Korea_Events.81.d: "After the reasons raised, people are still questions rather the king is fit for serving. The but the difference is, if they were criticizing the legitimacy by referring through old folklore, now they are using the confucianism idea for the reference. With this circumstances, it is clear that the literati factions are involved in incitement of this matter. We could intentionally root the opposite faction for silencing the voices raised, but it would harm the reason for what has been keeping the factionalism throughout the dynasty. But if we accept the truth, the legitimacy of current dynasty will be harmed greatly.\n\n\n\n §RIF WE DARE TO TAKE THE STEP ONCE MORE§!"
 ME_Korea_Events.81.a: "It's the forefather's flaws. I must take it."
 ME_Korea_Events.81.b: "Create the false treason evidence."
 ME_Korea_Events.82.t: "Grand Contention" 
 ME_Korea_Events.82.d: "As the variety of academic factions grows in numbers, it comes down to the time when the control over the scholars we seemed to have, is now out of control. Also, with conceding the great faults made by forefather, it has given a sign to the numerous factions that the time has come for them to propose reforms they think as rightious. The confucianism ideal makes those factions to try their best to get a seat in the government. And the with their seniors whom already set root in the house, all the newly born factions will struggle for introducing ideas. But embracing these reforms will be radical and cost very harshly on the society."
 ME_Korea_Events.82.a: "Our examination hall is flooding!"
 ME_Korea_Events.83.t: "The Letter of the Enlightenment"
 ME_Korea_Events.83.d: "One of the big obstacle for the raising the status of the people was the Chinese Letter that we use in the governmental officials. Without the knowledge of the letters, the commons won't have a chance to get through the imperial exam even if they are bright enough. Also, to send a proposal or a petition directly to the king must be written in the Chinese Letter. Abandoning the old letters and using the letter which the Sejong the Great as an official letter will greatly benefit the commons. However, this will clairfy the our stance against the Mandate of China, greatly angering the Chinese people we have in control."
 ME_Korea_Events.83.a: "We cannot abandon the letters of deep meaning!"
 ME_Korea_Events.83.b: "Confucicus said, ENLIGHTENMENT MUST SPREAD!"
 ME_Korea_Events.84.t: "Basics of the Society"
 ME_Korea_Events.84.d: "Followed by the growth of the new class, there has been movement of reconsideration on the current estate system. We have thought that the enlighted are the ones who passed exam questioning the Confucianist ideas by writting essay. But the bureaucrats in the palace don't stand a chance when they run into the people in their expertise. The ones grew to be bookworm can't farm their granted farmland, handle the capital accumulation, or fix the tools for themselves. Why should they be treated more speacial then any others, when they even statecraft themselves? The new wave of philosophy from west give us the answer for this. Perhaps we should embrace their idea to reform the society."
 ME_Korea_Events.84.a: "They are too radical ideas."
 ME_Korea_Events.84.b: "Follow the current trend."
 ME_Korea_Events.85.t: "Question of Nobi"
 ME_Korea_Events.85.d: "There has been numerous dispute for the nobi. Some say it is the path of the enlightenment, others say that it is evil custom to leave it. The Yangbans who has lot's of nobi in his hand strongly opposes this reform, and will likely to revolt since they will lose economic powers. However, all the indirect effort to reduce the numbers of nobi class seem to pay off. There are small numbers of nobi left in the country. If we push harder, the people in chains will be freed with slighter less cost then we expect."
 ME_Korea_Events.85.a: "Confucicus said, people belong in their stance."
 ME_Korea_Events.85.b: "We must get rid of what distorts the fundamental idea!"
 ME_Korea_Events.86.t: "Military Modernization"
 ME_Korea_Events.86.d: "The military ideas that western people has seems more fascinating as we study their achievements in those area. We tried to embrace those ideas earlier, and seem to have work fine with us. Today, we heard that western people has made more progress. But the difference between the former and current western idea is similarity of what we had. This new method is far more different. If we sought to integrate and adapt these, it will take total reconstruction of the military system we have. The resistance against our attempt will be humongous."
 ME_Korea_Events.86.a: "It's too costly."
 ME_Korea_Events.86.b: "There is no exeption."
 ME_Korea_Events.87.t: "Realizing Currency"
 ME_Korea_Events.87.d: "Since we minted the Sangpyeongtongbo, it has functioned as the means of the trade. It hasn't been a problem for a while due to the small users however, as time passed, the Circulation of coin stacked up too much, resulting the inflation. This has caused the problem in daily life. To buy a horse, you'll need a crate of coins to bring with. And the increase in the copper consumption made the raw material price to grow, lowering the seigniorage. It could be solved by minting out higher value coins and collecting the coins we have minted. But this decision could cause long term inflation and a forgery crimes to spike for a short period."
 ME_Korea_Events.87.a: "We already minted too much."
 ME_Korea_Events.87.b: "It's a cost to take."
 ME_Korea_Events.88.t: "Gongjo Expansion"
 ME_Korea_Events.88.d: "Through out time, Gongjo was the least wanted department in the government. The ceremonial rank of the department was the lowest, and poorly budgeted dispite of the tasks and responsibility they bear. However, recent influx of innovative engineering and technological knowledge, it has come to a time for to expand this sector into huge division. If we act now, we could easily catch up the western country's technological level. But it woud drastically drain our coffers."
 ME_Korea_Events.88.a: "Why should we bear financial problem for the third rank?"
 ME_Korea_Events.88.b: "The future lies in the engineering!"
 ME_Korea_Events.89.t: "Tax Modernization"
 ME_Korea_Events.89.d: "One of the problem we had all those year was the tax problem. We tried to alleviate the burden put to the peasants and commons while increasing government budget. But those effort was ironically counterfired by putting more burden to them. The source of the problem was all of our attempts were changes within the governmental ideology system. If we really want to lessen the strain we've put to them, there must be bold movement to take. Abolishing the speacial tax that has been put to the regional products, and full cash payment will save peasants and also enlarge our budget. However, it was one of the force that motivated the people to produce more goods in their place. If we abolish those tax, it could cause production problem for a period."
 ME_Korea_Events.89.a: "It will cause too much CHAOS!"
 ME_Korea_Events.89.b: "We need more budget!"
 ME_Korea_Events.90.t: "Law of Laws"
 ME_Korea_Events.90.d: "The Gyeonggukdaejeon made by former king had the comprehensive, administrative, common law aspect. All the reformed law couldn't wear off the influence of the Grand Code. Although it was seem as advanced during the time when it was first published, now it has become backward system. Even though supplemented laws helped to not get decay so easily, it is definitely certain that it is a object for reform. However, If we reform this law to be advanced once more, it would damage our legitimacy and reduce the absolute power we had."
 ME_Korea_Events.90.a: "How dare you question [Root.GetTitle]'s Authority!"
 ME_Korea_Events.90.b: "Everyone must be ruled by law. No exeptions."
 ME_Korea_Events.900.t: "Means of the People"
 ME_Korea_Events.900.d: "§MThe People's desire is the Heaven's desire. I heard executing the Janjeok, the worthless, in the name of justice, not a kingslayer.§!\nThe words of Mencious is the bottom line of the Confucianism ideas. This quote was written in the one of the reform suggested. When this was adressed in the court, the free-for-all situation suddenly became two sided civil war. One side insisted that the people is the foundation of the country, welfare and the rights of the people must be expanded. The other side refutes by sticking to Confucianism idea, saying without the self-enlightenment, those commons are not that quite different from the barbarians.\nThe debate continued for 7 days, and it didn't seem to stop. Now numerous bar and restaurant's main topic is the reform idea. There has been reports on chairshots, group fight, illigal duel is coming from all over the city. If we don't decide which faction to choose soon, there could be a riot among people."
 ME_Korea_Events.900.a: "The responsibility is the Enlightenment."
 ME_Korea_Events.900.b: "The Nation must ensure the people's desire"
 ME_Korea_Events.9000.t: "The Daybreak"
 ME_Korea_Events.9000.d: "After the meeting with the western people, there has been numerous incidents related to them. Now the time for result has come. One of the crucial part in the Confucianism idea is 'How to Statecraft the knowledge'. We learned new method of viewing this world, embraced it as a valuable, or rejected as petty.\nWhat has become of our state after all of the fuss. Was it worth it? Or it was not."
 ME_Korea_Events.9000.a: "The history from now on will decide."
 
 
 #Hwanguk - Who would ever pick this route??
 
 ME_Korea_Events.666.t: "Hwanguk of [GetYear]"
 ME_Korea_Events.666.d: "As the literati's intention to check the [Root.GetTitle]'s powers has getting stronger as the time passes. The original design of our government system was the harmony among the king and bureaucrats. But they have crossed the step way over the limits. Their real intention of recent actions are not only to keep the harmony, but lust for puppeting the king for their own interests. It is clear that when the [Root.Monarch] dies, all the bureaucrats will rush for incapacitation of the new [Root.GetTitle]. We must act now and show them the mighty power of the king by purging the faction we were rooting for. It might permanently damage the factionalism system, who cares? The ones who tries to sit on the [Root.GetTitle] must be executed for lese-majesty."
 ME_Korea_Events.666.a: "Kill them, ALL."
 ME_Korea_Events.6661.t: "Hwanguk of [GetYear]"
 ME_Korea_Events.6661.d: "We purged the head of the faction and other seniors along with. This made the opposite faction in those time to grasp the power. But easier the power was given the less gratitude they show. The newly ascended faction behaives like they siezed the power only by their own."
 ME_Korea_Events.6661.a: "Time to switch powers."
 ME_Korea_Events.6662.t: "Hwanguk of [GetYear]"
 ME_Korea_Events.6662.d: "The ones who threatened the [Root.GetTitle]'s legitimacy was back with the change of power in the court. Although we crippled them by purging key persons and the executives of the factions, they had no choice to defy the king's authority or the legitimacy anymore. However, as the time passes, their stance is gradually returning to the old rebellious way. Perhaps it's time to show once more what the [Root.GetTitle] means in this land."
 ME_Korea_Events.6662.a: "No powers shall go farther then 10 years!"
 ME_Korea_Events.6663.t: "Major Houses Takes Power"
 ME_Korea_Events.6663.d: "After [Root.GetTitle] death, The authority built was taken away also. The mighy power that monarch had was checked by Saheonbu's Daegwan, Saganwon's Gangwan, Hongmungwan's Gwanwon. But these division were neutralized as the factional literaties were used to enforce the [Root.GetTitle]'s power.\nNow the newly succeeded [Root.Monarch.GetName] is left alone in the court with few loyal bureaucrats, the rest is gritting own teeth for revenge of the fallen teacher. To ensure [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] power to function properly, he need the power of the closest reletive, The consort. The consort's family is demanding the transfer of the power for a time to purge all the people who wishes to defy the new [Root.GetTitle]. [Root.Monarch.GetName] doesn't seem to have choice to lend [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sword to them.\nWhich turned out to be madness. The [Root.Consort.GetName] purged all of the bureaucrats and filled the people close to them. Now, the $COUNTRY$ is in the hands of the [Root.Consort.GetName]'s family."
 ME_Korea_Events.6663.a: "What [Root.Monarch.GetName] have done???"
 ME_Korea_Events.6664.t: "Breaking Realm"
 ME_Korea_Events.6664.d: "As the Major families oligopolized the country for themselves, the system that was meant to help the commons are now turning back to them. Few revolts are uprising to show the discontent, but it will make the problem worse."
 ME_Korea_Events.6664.a: "System is Breaking Apart!"
 ME_Korea_Events.6665.t: "Total Breakdown of the [Root.GovernmentName]"
 ME_Korea_Events.6665.d: "As the system was broken apart, The administrating region is reduced to the capital area. The central government don't have enough power to get knowledge of the rural area, exept for handful of major cites. The court is filled with the bureaucrats who bought the exam paper or the rank. Regional government is reaping the peasants for filling their break-even point of the cost they paid to get commissioned. The tax is now imposed to the dead and the young. There is military only in the ledger.\nAll of our achievements is gone in the sands of time."

 #catholic believer 
 KOR_catholic_believers_0.d: "The fascinating technological advance of the western world gave big impression to our people. The only way to catch up to them is to learn what path they walked through, the books they wrote, the root of the idea they have. We've studied the greek philosophy, disassembled it to bits by bits. But that wasn't enough. To fully understand them, we had to study not only roots but also the stem and leaves of the western ideas, the Christianity.\nThough it is not that encouraged to study the theism religion, young scholars took the risk of studing it. While researching the christian idea, one scholar took his feet too deep. He was known as radical man, but when he looked into the light of the God, he realized his true nature. The answer he seeked for his lifetime was in the holy scripture.\nWith his friends and comrades, he quickly formed the theory that would work effectivly on Korean. In few months, many people were swayed by his theory. Now, many people in the region believes Catholic."
 KOR_catholic_believers_1.d: "While studing the westology, a young scholar had fallen asleep. While dreaming, he felt the warmth in his back. Just like cuddle of his mother. He heard whisper in his ear, \n'Wake up, my child. Father has task for you to take. Spread the word of the Father to the People in this land.'\nStartled, he woke up fast, almost crashing his head on the wall. He looked around the room, the warmth from the fireplace was all around. But there was different source of heat from the door. It was almost daybreak however, sun was not even out yet. Curiously, he slowly opened the door. Suddenly, There was a flash of light pouring into his eyes.\nA maiden with robe of rainbow feathers was standing in the middle of light. Scholar rubbed his eyes to see clear, but when he opened his eyes, the strange happening was gone. Mocking himself for seeing the hallucination for the tiredness, he turned back to his house.\nBefore he took the first step, something was caught on his foot. A Wooden Cross. He knew that this thing was placed on the shelf. When he picked up the cross, he could feel the warmth from the flash. With fear and delight, he now know what task is lying ahead."
 KOR_catholic_believers_2.d: "An aged scholar was trailing through the mountain for the imperial examination. It was getting dark, and there was no jumak near by. If the night comes, he'll be most likely to become tiger's lovely meal. Among the tree shadows of the twilight, he saw the flicker of light. Focusing his sight, he could barly see the jumak's roof shape. With gladness, he sped up his pace to get there just in time.\nHow much did he walk? He could smell the kimchi's fermented scent, the fragrance of the bone stew. He was almost there.All of sudden, he felt the goosebumps in his back. A Low growl he knew very well was coming from his flank. Realizing that he was a dead man, he silently recalled his wife and his daughter. Shortly after, he wouldn't be able to see them forever.\nWhen tiger jumped, he closed his eyes. Hoping the quick death from the shock. But after a several heartbeat, the pain or the impact didn't occure. Slowly, he opened his eyes and surprised with astonishment. The tiger was kneeling infront of the beautiful woman, emitting holy aura and gentle light. She turned to the scholar smiled and said, 'Don't be afraid. Father always watches over his lambs.'.\nWhen the woman patted the tiger, that beast slowly turned and ran to the dark forest. After that miracle, she shimmered into the thin air, leaving the jade embedded cross necklace. When scholar picked up that treasure, he suddenly remembered the Daniel's story. The exam didn't matter for him anymore. God is with him now."
 KOR_catholic_believers_3.d: "The dispute for the reservoir rights has risen between two towns. Normally, this kind of dispute would be resolved through seokjeon, but the love-triangle for the femboy and political blunder made by local governor made the strife to spike high. A local humble man tried to postpone the regular seokjeon, yet, blinded by rage, none would listen. The night before, he secretly wrote a report to the governor about the huge tension and pleading to stop them.\nHe prepared the night ride to the government office. When blew off the lamp, the dark fell into the room. But then, a cross he was keeping in his house shimmered with holy light. Unconsiously, he grabbed the cross. Then, the maiden in robe of feathers appeared to him and gave revelation.\n\n'Stand in the middle of the fight, and everything will be solved.'\nMysterious maiden disappeared just with that quote, but the lamp he blew out was lit again. While riding back and forth through night ride, he tought about the words he heard.\nWhen the sun rose, people from each town gathered with rocks, A club and shield in their hands, sling on the belt, eyes filled with hatred. The regional guards are not yet reached.\nLeaders met in the middle, ultimatum was annouced with the terms from each. Of course, it wasn't unagreeable to both. They returned to the base and horn blew. The rocks flew to each side, and the phalanx marched foward. That was when humble man walked to the right center of mayhem. He instictively kneeled down, both hands put together. The rocks that had less energy dropped down to him. It was obvious his head would be smashed. But then, the light from the sky shone upon him. The rocks in the air lost the power and dropped to the ground. When the miracle shook the crowd in awe, the maiden from the last night gradually descended, riding the light. Everyone at the area lowered their head.\nWhen the will to fight was gone, maiden smiled and ascended to the sky, withdrawing the light. The leaders from each side came to the center again and asked man how to solve the problem. He answered with rational and mutual acceptable terms."
