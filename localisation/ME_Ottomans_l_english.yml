 ME_Ottoman_Events.1.d: "The Sultan Murad II, famed for the conquest of the Beyliks in Anatolia and the Kingdoms in the Balkans, led the Ottoman army to victory against the Christian Coalition at the Battle of Varna not long ago. It is said that he dismounted and fell to his knees and prayed mid-battle, something a legendary Caliph had done. The battle immediately turned in their favor. Murad II styled himself like this - a Ghazi King - strongly, as one meant to embody the virtues of an honest warrior. Despite that, he had grown tired of his nearly two decades of constant warfare, for he did not enjoy ruling from the throne or the responsibilities that went with it. He decided to abdicate the throne to his son, Mehmed II following the victory at Varna. Despite that he was only given short reprieve until a Janissary riot against Mehmed II had forced him to once again take the reins and lead again."

In the first decades of the Mamluk rule, their state was prospering, but their luck would quickly run out, as their sultanate entered a state of decay which lasts until today. Currently, the Mamluks have succumbed to our invasion, and their lands lie at our mercy. Furthermore, we have been offered an opportunity: we leave the lands under mamluk control with large autonomy in exchange for formal rule over the whole sultanate.
