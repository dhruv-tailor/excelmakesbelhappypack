 # Missions:
 malacca_malaccan_rebirth_title: "Malaccan Rebirth"
 malacca_malaccan_rebirth_desc: "The relatively stagnant nature of our military technological development is slightly terrifying considering our power-hungry neighbors. To ensure something similar to the downfall of Srivijaya never happens again, we must ensure we are ahead of the times."
 malacca_expansion_of_the_diplomatic_corps_title: "Diplomatic Corps"
 malacca_expansion_of_the_diplomatic_corps_desc: "We must focus on without as much as within in regards to the affairs of state. Either of these fields would be beneficial to the state."
 malacca_the_grand_knights_title: "The Grand Knights"
 malacca_the_grand_knights_desc: "Our military leadership has been proceeding quite well--though not well enough. Our neighbors vie for our territory and our previous advancements cannot sustain us for long. The time has come to learn."
 malacca_chinese_kin_title: "Chinese Kin"
 malacca_chinese_kin_desc: "Our allies in China were some of the first to acknowledge our independence from the spiteful Javans and moreover solidify our place in this dangerous world after the fall of Srivijaya. If nothing else, we owe them our gratitude and loyalty."
 malacca_heavenly_aspirations_title: "Heavenly Aspirations"
 malacca_heavenly_aspirations_desc: "The Chinese are to us as Allah is to life: the lord and savior, the divine protector, and the ultimate dictator. We are subject to their whims, but this is not necessarily adverse to our prosperity. They are a mighty empire full of innovations and people beyond what we currently possess. We would do well to become more like them."
 malacca_holy_mission_title: "The Holy Mission"
 malacca_holy_mission_desc: "Our spiritual realizations have ultimately culminated to the following question: what now? The answer is obvious: we spread our faith beyond its original borders to encompass new heights. This may put us in a position to later secure territory following the same faith and serve as a protector of sorts."
 malacca_devine_recompense_title: "Divine Recompense"
 malacca_devine_recompense_desc: "Our newly acquired territories follow a strange faith of Indian origin. Though we have nothing against the Indians, their religion is not welcome within our borders. If we make an example now, we can ensure future conversions will be much easier."
 malacca_englightened_empire_title: "Enlightened Empire"
 malacca_englightened_empire_desc: "We are nearly complete in our utter explosion of divinity and enlightenment. We must solidify our faith among the people before we can complete our grand projects and our transition into a heavenly empire, free of conflict and crime."
 malacca_malaysian_bottleneck_title: "Malaysian Bottleneck"
 malacca_malaysian_bottleneck_desc: "There is only one land passage from the North to our capital. Though we have the protection of the Chinese, we cannot take their generosity for granted. Securing neighboring territories in the north to rout possible enemies through one passage would be extremely beneficial to our national defense."
 malacca_spicy_munition_title: "Spicy Munition"
 malacca_spicy_munition_desc: "North of our newly acquired bottleneck territories lies additional buffer territory between us and the immense wealth of Siam. We have decided that securing Siamese trade is the key to securing our own trade, therefore we must overcome these provinces immediately."
 malacca_the_fearful_elephant_title: "The Fearful Elephant"
 malacca_the_fearful_elephant_desc: "It is finally time to begin our invasion of the Gleaming City of [600.GetName]. China currently exerts much of its influence upon our destination, but, given our status in their empire, surely they would not dare to retaliate. The time has come to assert out dominance over the pitiful northerners."
 malacca_the_bold_mouse_title: "The Bold Mouse"
 malacca_the_bold_mouse_desc: "We have pushed the meek elephant back, allowing the elegant mouse to rise to prestige and glory. We have a solid foothold in Southeast Asia, but we must must strengthen it, allowing for us to finally gain a grip on Siamese trade and moreover gain closer borders to China, our everlasting protector under the sun."
 malacca_the_ancient_kingdoms_title: "The Ancient Kingdoms"
 malacca_the_ancient_kingdoms_desc: "The two kingdoms of [KHM.GetName] and [CHA.GetName] have long since coexisted and both have prospered for centuries. The might and prestige of these trading kingdoms is at our disposal, we only wait for the order to do so. In bringing these two kingdoms under our control, we solidify our control of Siamese trade once and for all."
 malacca_the_last_swipe_title: "The Last Swipe"
 malacca_the_last_swipe_desc: "We have inadvertently found ourselves in a miraculous situation. If we push farther north along the South China Sea, we may establish a border with China. Though we cannot be sure how they will initially react, one thing remains constant: they are rich. If they have money, then it would be in our best interest to alleviate their dreadful surplus."
 malacca_mercantile_jihad_title: "Mercantile Jihad"
 malacca_mercantile_jihad_desc: "Our recent excursions near China have forced us to realize our true potential: the Empire of China itself. Our vast territories and immense expansion leave us with countless options for the future. It is time to decide what we do with our government."
 malacca_prepare_sumatran_invasion_title: "Sumatran Invasion"
 malacca_prepare_sumatran_invasion_desc: "The island of Sumatra has long since been a part of our empire until its eventual collapse. Though the region will be extremely useful to controlling trade in the region, and more specifically have complete control over the straits, we can better put it to use by making a staging area for future Javan campaigns to show that scum that we are truly superior."
 malacca_northern_trust_title: "Northern Trust"
 malacca_northern_trust_desc: "It is time to pick up the Pasai vermin to the North. With them out of the way, we will be able to assert our control over the remaining parts of Sumatra. The fact that the Pasai are our main competitors for trade is simply a bonus."
 malacca_indonesian_ambition_title: "Indonesian Ambition"
 malacca_indonesian_ambition_desc: "By a complete accident, Sumatra has nearly completely fallen under our control. The other sultanates and kingdoms of the region cower in fear at our might. We cannot allow our neighbors to feel in such a way. We may be able to put them at ease--by ousting their weak rulers and replacing them with strong, [Root.GetAdjective] leadership."
 malacca_borneo_landing_title: "Borneo Landing"
 malacca_borneo_landing_desc: "We are finally in a position to reclaim ancient Srijiyavan land in Borneo. If we do this correctly, we can use these lands as both a base for the consolidation of Borneo and as a launching point for the eventual and utterly efficient conquest of Indonesia."
 malacca_brunei_doctrine_title: "Brunei Doctrine"
 malacca_brunei_doctrine_desc: "We suspect [BEI.GetName] will put up a significant resistance upon our eventual invasion. It would be within our best interests to make substantial preparations before invading, including territory surrounding their nation from both sides as to ensure they cannot escape. The capacity for a naval blockade would also be useful."
 malacca_powerful_insurrection_title: "Powerful Insurrection"
 malacca_powerful_insurrection_desc: "How ironic is it that, though [BEI.GetName] was one of the conductors of our downfall, we now will be the conductors of theirs? The singular moment in which we enter their capital will be our enactment of revenge."
 malacca_rightful_heir_to_srivijaya_title: "Rightful Heir to Srivijaya"
 malacca_rightful_heir_to_srivijaya_desc: "We are not the first to have inhabited these lands, though if we're smart, we may be the last. One of our predecessors happens to be Srivijaya, a powerful trading kingdom. Our founding prince, Parasmeswara, was a prince of the collapsing Srivijaya. In order to take revenge on the spiteful Majapahit scum that ended Srivijayan rule over Sumatra, we must first not only proclaim our legacy, but display it to the world through our splendor."
 malacca_a_mercantile_tradition_title: "A Mercantile Tradition"
 malacca_a_mercantile_tradition_desc: "For centuries our ruler has taxed all who have come through the Straits with goods. We have grown complacent, relying on this tax far too much to supply the majority of our nation's income. The time has come to fix this grave oversight. A large portion of our population remains merchants who may be willing to encourage trade to travel through the Straits, given we have a fleet grand enough to accompany their presence."
 malacca_grand_inhibition_title: "Grand Inhibition"
 malacca_grand_inhibition_desc: "Our Javan competitors have gone too far in their futile competition, nearly ousting us from Malaccan trade altogether. It is time to show them who reigns supreme over the region--through cunning or through gunpowder."
 malacca_nailing_the_coffin_title: "Nailing the Coffin"
 malacca_nailing_the_coffin_desc: "It is finally time to finish off Java and their spiteful ways. [MAJ.GetName], the greedy bastards that orchestrated our fall from grace, will know fear as we cross their borders and slaughter their armies, showing our incredible power and slashing their hopes of ever being free again. Their distasteful past has come back to haunt them."
 malacca_sulawesi_doctrine_title: "Sulawesi Doctrine"
 malacca_sulawesi_doctrine_desc: "While we're in the area, it would be wise to bring Sulawesi under our control both for their valuable spices and their strategic vicinity to Mindanao, another vital area to our success."
 malacca_filipino_doctrine_title: "Filipino Doctrine"
 malacca_filipino_doctrine_desc: "The vast island chain to our north though fairly desolate, can be useful to us in trading ventures with the nearby Chinese Empire. Our tributary status with China allows for some freedom of trade, but our distance from them makes it extremely difficult. Expanding into nearby islands will secure further opportunities and thus is imperative to our survival."
 
 MLC_UNLOCKS_PROPAGATE_RELIGION_FOR_OTHER_RELIGIONS: "Unlocks the §YPropagate Religion§! trading policy for §Y[Root.GetName]§!, no matter what religion [Root.GetName] follows."
