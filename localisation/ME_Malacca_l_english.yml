He served as a bendahara - a rank somewhat similar to modern prime minister - and was a military leader who helped spread the malaccan islam to neighboring states as well as stop the expansion of the ambitious Siamese. It is said that Tun Perak didn't seek revenge even after his son was killed after a misunderstanding with the Sultan's son."

Since then it is almost certain it grew to be a port of significance under the name Temasek. Unfortunately, this prosperity was not bound to last, for Singapura was betrayed by one of its ministers, who promptly helped the Majapahit Empire defeat and raze Singapura. The monarch-at-the-time, Parameswara, was forced to flee and subsequently founded Malacca and the Malaccan Sultanate. However, we were able to return these lands back to the glory they once held."
