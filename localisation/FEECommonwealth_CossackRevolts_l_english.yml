Although Commonwealth crown cannot control their actions directly, they are still responsible for this.\n\nWe could threaten their king with war if they won't tame these annoying vermins. Yet there is a chance that they won't back off, and in that case we would have to talk reason into them with fire and sword."

    cr_6_desc: "After Kosinski captured Bila Tserkva, he named himself a Hetman of the Cossacks and with that kindled a full-scale revolt against the rule of the Polish crown and the local Ruthenian Nobility.\n\nAlthough it looks bad, our chancellor assures us that it's just yet another struggle for power in this unruly region so we shouldn't mobilize our troops for intervention and Ostrogski family, perhaps the most powerful noble family in Ruthenia is more than capable of dealing with that themselves."

They've also reported about atrocities that rebels had committed against Polish nobility and Catholic clergy in Mahilyow.\n\nAt the same time, we have received a peace offer from Nalyvaiko in which he requires us to cede some of the lands in exchange for their military service and loyalty to the Commonwealth. Now, we have a choice how to end this. Either we accept peace offer and bring an end to this quickly. Or we can drown Ruthenian lands in blood once again."

    cr_19_title: "Negotiations with Rebels"

Later, the rebels offered to hand over the leaders of the rebellion, including Nalyvaiko on the same terms.\n\nOf course we can agree to this, but considering the havoc and destructions the had caused, our Nobility is expecting from us to deal with every single one of them accordingly."
