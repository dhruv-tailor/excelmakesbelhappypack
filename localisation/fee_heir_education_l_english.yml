 heir_education.102.d: "Throughout the years of their youth, our heir has become a shadow mastermind. $HEIR$ has been trained in intrigue and espionage since a young age, revealing a hidden talent that has been trained to its true potential.

However, our heir's affairs in the underground world has made $HEIR_O_PRONOUN$ overly reliant on networks and assassins and not so much in the face of actual danger.

 heir_education.104.t: "Gullible Genius"

Our scholars has claimed him to be one of the most intelligent people in the realm and we wear it with pride. However, there is a downside. Despite $HEIR$ intelligence is unrivalled, his naivety and lack of practical skills is an issue, unable to engage in diplomatic conversation or make the right moves.

 heir_education.105.t: "Master of the Sword"

In the end, this made our heir a person of great military skill, mastering the vast battlefield by day and strategising the next move at night. However, $HEIR$ focus on military skills means $HEIR_S_PRONOUN$ other subjects are suffering ad in turn, this makes $HEIR_ADJ$ ignorant to politics or bureaucracy.

 heir_education.105.a: "A fine addition to the dynasty."

 heir_education.106.d: "Throughout the years of their youth, our heir has become a pragmatic jury. $HEIR$ was one of the few pupils that had a keen interest in law & politics, to our courtier's relief. While just as confused as everyone after learning all about the intriciacies of the laws of our country, $HEIR$ took an initiative to dedicate $HEIR_ADJ$ education to the greater good of justice, attending many noisy debates and memorized pages upon pages about our realm's laws, politics and bureaucracy, making $HEIR_O_PRONOUN$ one of the few who have the privilege of knowing the in's and out's of the convoluted mess that is the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. Our education has made $HEIR$ into a pragmatic jury."
 heir_education.106.a: "Finally, someone who likes paperwork."

 heir_education.107.t: "Dim Pupil"
 heir_education.107.d: "Throughout the years of their youth, our heir has become a dim pupil. $HEIR$ was blessed to be born as a $DYNASTY$, unfortunately this doesn't mean that $HEIR_S_PRONOUN$ was blessed with wit or charm. Barely passing his classes, or what's left of it after his tutors were too frustrated, our heir has never been particularly good at anything and is in fact, quite dim. This has made $HEIR$ more careless and clumsy, some even think $HEIR_S_PRONOUN$'s' unable to fulfil $HEIR_ADJ$ expected duties as future monarch. Unable to do proper paperwork, horrible at negotiating and too cowardly to run an army, it seems that this isn't our finest moment in history. Our education has made $HEIR$ into a dim pupil."
 heir_education.107.a: "May god help us..."

 heir_education.108.t: "Merry Drunkard"
 heir_education.108.d: "Throughout the years of their youth, our heir has become merry drunkard. $HEIR$ could've been many things throughout his childhood, however out of all the paths of life, it seems that our heir has chosen no more than a common alcoholic. To the dismay of our courtiers, $HEIR$ has evolved from taking a few sips into whole bottles, often missing for days and found in pubs and brothels all over $CAPITAL_CITY$, squandering what little wealth $HEIR_S_PRONOUN$  had on wine and bear and mead. This has made $HEIR$ particularly unintelligent, unable to do the simplest of mathematics or even write properly in $CULTURE$ but to our surprise, $HEIR$ is extraordinarily talented at persuasion and diplomacy, owing his silver-tongue to spending time in the shady pubs. Furthermore, $HEIR_S_PRONOUN$ has connections in and out of $COUNTRY$ with large connections of friends in the more darker parts of politics, warfare and commerce."
 heir_education.108.a: "Last thing I need is a drunkard..."

 heir_education.109.t: "Not-so-Bright Warrior"
 heir_education.109.d: "Throughout the years of their youth, our heir has become a not-so-bright warrior. $HEIR$ is a very unique child. Growing up within the castle walls, our courtiers observe that $HEIR$ possesses a great talent for strength, even to a point that $HEIR_S_PRONOUN$ was able to lift and toss around objects more nearly twice his weight with ease. Our priests claim that this was a great gift from the heavens, but it would be a gift if $HEIR$ wasn't so incredibly slow. While our generals make use of $HEIR_ADJ$ strength by training $HEIR$ in the art of warfare, which $HEIR_S_PRONOUN$ succeeded with flying colors, little could be done about his dull intellect. Having trouble with even reading and slurring in his speech, our heir was never destined for knowledge. Our education has made $HEIR$ a not-so-bright warrior."
 heir_education.109.a: "Looks like it does run in the family."

 heir_education.110.t: "Pious Zealot"
 heir_education.110.d: "Throughout the years of their youth, our heir has become a pious zealot. $HEIR$ has been devoting $HEIR_ADJ$ life to religious duties and praying as the young royal sought to seek clarity, wisdom and guidance from the almighty heavens. Spending most of $HEIR_ADJ$ time in the temples and often discussing the scriptures with older priests, $HEIR$ is committed to be a pious servant for the heavens and unlike many youths around $HEIR_O_PRONOUN$, abstains from luxurious goods and alcohol, instead donating his time to charity and the lesser fortunate. Unfortunately, this has cause $HEIR$ to become sheltered and often naive to the more cruel world where deceit and lies exist, often choosing to do ambitiously impossible tasks in the name of god such as ending corruption. Our education has made $HEIR$ a pious zealot."
 heir_education.110.a: "We are truly blessed."

 heir_education.111.t: "Curious Skeptic"
 heir_education.111.d: "Throughout the years of their youth, our heir has become a curious skeptic. $HEIR$ was always considered to be a nosy child, often snooping around the courts and getting his nose into other people's business, to the dismay or pleasure of our subjects. Furthermore, as $HEIR$ get older, our assigned tutors and educators noticed that $HEIR$ is often quite stubborn and refuse to indulge in the scriptures, holy texts or stories that is presented, often asking too many questions and complaining of its credibility, earning him his skeptical attitude. This in turn however, has made $HEIR$ to be great at $HEIR_ADJ$ more materialistic subjects such as the sciences, philosophy and geometry as well as being more careful around our more zealous courtiers. Our education has made $HEIR$ a curious skeptic."
 heir_education.111.a: "Shush! Don't let the inquisitors know!"

 heir_education.112.t: "Unfortunate Gambler"
 heir_education.112.d: "Throughout the years of their youth, our heir has become a unfortunate gambler. Somewhere down the line, $HEIR$ was interested in the gambling and while it started out with a few peanuts, as they got older it spiralled as every coin turned from their hand into the opponents, never stopping to look whether the mirage of the 'jackpot' is real. Whether its bad parenting or bad supervision, its no doubt that this has led $HEIR$ to crave risks and often take careless decisions, some even nearly cost their life. Whether this was a product of failed education or the absence of it, our heir can be expected to gamble the treasury empty."
 heir_education.112.a: "I bet my coffers are already empty."

 heir_education.113.t: "Believer of the Occult"
 heir_education.113.d: "Throughout the years of their youth, our heir has become a believer of the occult. Whether it was by luck or destiny, $HEIR$ was always captivated in the mysteries and dark secrets of the world, never ending in $HEIR_ADJ$ pursuit towards immortality, god-like abilities or universal secrets. This has made our heir to join many secret cults, whether legal or illegal, their practices are mostly deemed heretical and some rumored satanic. Believing in witchcraft and sorcery, our heir has become a believer of the occult, whether it's just an elaborate scam or truly a hidden path in life, this was definitely not a phase." 
 heir_education.113.a: "This is horribly heretical!"

 heir_education.114.t: "Mercantile Maestro"
 heir_education.114.d: "Throughout the years of their youth, our heir has become a mercantile maestro. Through the stroke of genius or luck, $HEIR$ has always been fond of money and with it the great interest of commerce, trade and economies. Despite this, little was actually learned at schools or academies but $HEIR$ found a hidden talent for bartering and negotiating that lead $HEIR_O_PRONOUN$ to become a known maestro in all that shines. Our heir knows the markets, and $HEIR_S_PRONOUN$ knows it well, experiencing the trade first-hand by eye not by paper."
 heir_education.114.a: "Must've run in the family."

 heir_education.115.t: "Jolly Performer"
 heir_education.115.d: "Throughout the years of their youth, our heir has become a jolly performer. Never finding much talent in diplomatic, administrative or military tasks, $HEIR$ was a lost cause to many of our courtiers yet unknown at the time, $HEIR$ was gifted with the talent of pleasing patrons and entertaining crowds, able to entertain many with $HEIR_ADJ$ plays, tragedies and musical, as well as vocal, talent. Born to be on stage, $HEIR$ has mastered the art of acting and music, able to play several instruments and often finding joy in entertaining people with them. Due to this however, our heir is frowned upon our military, often seeing $HEIR$ as not fit for rule since a monarch do not play the lute or entertain the dull masses."
 heir_education.115.a: "I don't know whether I'm entertained or amused."
 
 heir_education.200.t: "Extra Lessons?"
 heir_education.200.d: "As our heir continues to grow into a stronger, more educated heir; some have suggested that we should place [Root.Heir.GetHerHimCap] into more lessons to learn some specialities. \nMany different classes would involve giving [Root.Heir.GetHerHimCap] more administrative duties to learn from, or we could task [Root.Heir.GetHerHimCap] with learning more proper Etiquette in a court of diplomats or even train [Root.Heir.GetHerHimCap] to be a better swordfighter with Fencing training."
