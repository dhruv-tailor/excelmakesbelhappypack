 FEE_Historical_Events.1.T: "The Year Without a Summer"
 FEE_Historical_Events.1.D: "In what is quickly turning out to be a worldwide disaster, it seems that summer never came this year. Sunshine and warmth have been driven out of much of the world, replaced by incessant rainfall and constant fog. Worse, ice and frost have appeared in the height of summer hundreds of miles further south than it has ever been during summer. No one knows exactly what has caused this unusual year, although reports of a massive volcanic eruption in the East Indies seem to coincide with it. The effects, however, are worldwide. \nIn Asia, the monsoons were disrupted, causing floods in China and India, while in northern Europe the constant rain and low temperatures caused massive crop failures. In North America, grain crops failed and many were reduced to boiling herbs for sustenance. Around the world, a wave of cholera, typhus, and other diseases typically associated with poverty and starvation followed quickly on the heels of food shortages. \nPrices have risen dramatically as desperate people are willing to sell their very souls for bread, even as many lose their homes and are reduced to begging. Large estates, many already in debt from lavish living, now teeter on the verge of bankruptcy. The widespread shortages have led to a sharp increase in violence as rioters chanting “Bread or Blood” demand food that doesn’t exist."
