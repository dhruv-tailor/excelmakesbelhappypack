The need for a central rule has been deemed an absolute must for many, even some avid supporters of the Parliamentarian system, while the opposition argues that a King is a thing of the past, and only another means of oppression, from within."

This sudden shift has brought into question the nature of our cultural identity; as we continue to conquer Lloegr, the Welsh people will quickly become a minority in our own nation.

 brl_ideas_2: "Pagan Traditions"

 brl_ideas_6: "Combined Arms"
 brl_ideas_6_desc: "The Celtic people are a varied mass from all walks of life. Warriors, especially find themselves experts in all manner of combat. Learning from everyones' specialties and integrating them into our armies will only create a more effective fighting force."
