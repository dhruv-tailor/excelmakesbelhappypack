 fee_POL.9.t: "The Statutes of Nieszawa"
 fee_POL.9.d: "Przywilej cerekwicko-nieszawski were laws enacted in Poland in 1454, that gave the nobles, the szlachta, several priveliges and concessions. The laws stated that the king required the approval of the nobles when issuing new laws, levying forces or introducing new taxes. \nThe reason king Casimir IV Jagiellon agreed to this was the need for support in the Thirteen Years War against the Teutonic Order. While the war led towards the absorption of the Teutonic lands into Poland, the Statutes of Nieszawa laid the groundwork for the coming conflicts between the king and the szlachta."
 fee_POL.9.a: "Accept the conventions."
 fee_POL.9.b: "Refuse to sign and defy the Magnates!"
 fee_POL.1.t: "Statutes of Piotrokow"
 fee_POL.1.d: "Konstytucje piotrkowskie was a collection of laws passed in 1496 under king John I Olbracht who, in the tradition of his forebears, made concessions to the szlachta in exchange for their support in war. The szlachta were guaranteed certain rights, including relief from specific taxes and exclusive access to some Church offices. \nThe laws also affected the situation of peasants in the country, restricting them to their lands. After 1496, only one peasant from each village could leave per year, and only one person from a given peasant family was allowed to move to the growing towns. City burghers were also restricted from holding royal and national offices. \nFinally, the statues emphasised the rivers of Poland, removing all internal tariffs on waterways."
 fee_POL.1.a: "Enact as the szlactha require."
 fee_POL.1.b: "The king will not be forced!"
 fee_POL.11.t: "Union of Vilnius"
 fee_POL.11.d: "Unia krakowsko-wileñska was an attempt at taking a major step in the unification of Poland and Lithuania. It was signed by both Polish and Lithuanian nobles in 1499, and described two equal states in perpetual alliance. The countries would select their own leaders with the approval of the other, but would always support each other in armed conflicts. \nHowever, the Union did not last long in that state. Polish nobles soon began to protest it, mainly because it emphasised Lithuania as much as Poland. The reasoning they gave however, was that it was based on an old union of 1413, which they claimed there was no evidence for."
 fee_POL.11.a: "Our countries should cooperate."
 fee_POL.11.b: "Our countries are better off as just friends."
 fee_POL.12.t: "The Privilege of Mielnik"
 fee_POL.12.d: "The Przywilej mielnicki was an act passed by king Alexander Jagiellon in 1501, that expanded the powers of the magnates and the Sejm, to the point where it practically introduced a republican form of government. The king lost many rights, and was effectively demoted to the head of the Sejm, which held all real power. \nHowever, after being elected as head of the Sejm, the king never confirmed the priveliges, and it gradually became apparent that the struggle between the king and the greater Sejm harmed the nobles more than the new status quo helped them. \nIn 1504, the legal change was rejected by the Sejm, and while the struggle between the nobles and the king would continue for a long time, this battle had ended in Alexander's favor."
 fee_POL.12.a: "Grant the privilege."
 fee_POL.12.b: "Reject these outrageous demands!"
 fee_POL.13.t: "The Union of Mielnik"
 fee_POL.13.d: "The Unia mielnicka was one of the first attempts to unite Poland and Lithuania into a single state. Previously the two countries had co-existed in personal union through the king, but the Union of Mielnik would unite them into a single entity. The suggestion of the union was not well-received in Lithuania, as Polish magnates were attempting to force Polish culture and traditions onto the other country, and nobles there led a revolt against the Poles. In the end, the union was neither ratified by the Lithuanian Seimas or the Polish Sejm, and the countries remained separate in personal union for nearly seventy years more before they were finally united. "
 fee_POL.13.a: "Unite our nations under Poland. (This will cause massive revolts among the Lithuanians.)"
 fee_POL.13.b: "Don't force anyone to sign this."
 fee_POL.14.t: "Lithuanians Revolt Against the Union"
 fee_POL.14.d: "After the introduction of the Union of Mielnik, Lithuanian nobles have banded together in massive numbers to rise up against their Polish counterparts. Through the union, magnates have insisted on instituting Polish language in education and bureaucracy, as well as rule by Polish traditions. Now the Lithuanians have decided to fight back with arms."
 fee_POL.14.a: "You were warned."
 fee_POL.15.t: "1504 Reforms Passed Before the King"
 fee_POL.15.d: "In 1504, the Sejm piotrowski passed measures to restrict the king's control over the national treasury, effectively placing the Sejm in control of state funds. \nThe Sejm did not get the measures passed without negotiation, however. Nobles were from now on forbidden from holding more than a single official administrative post. In addition, Polish magnates had to return much land that had previously been seized from the king, thereby compensating somewhat for the financial authority the king lost."
 fee_POL.15.a: "You lose some, you... win some?"
 fee_POL.16.t: "Nothing New Without the Common Consent"
 fee_POL.16.d: "Nihil novi nisi commune consensu was an act adopted by the Sejm in 1505 at Radom. It forbade the king to issue laws without the consent of the nobility. This consent would be given through the Senat and the Chamber of Deputies. \nThe only exceptions were laws governing royal cities, crown lands, mines, fiefdoms, royal peasants, and Jews. These exceptions can be traced by the meaning of the law's name in Polish, \"Nothing About Us Without Us.\""
 fee_POL.16.a: "The nobles can be of great aid."
 fee_POL.16.b: "This is too far! No more power to the nobles!"
 fee_POL.17.t: "The Privilege of Torun"
 fee_POL.17.d: "Przywilej toruñski was enacted in 1520 by the Polish king, granting the szlachta greater control over people living on their lands. Peasants were forced to pay serfdom to their masters, and prevented them from leaving their villages. This was a part of the greater trend of introducing serfdom in Eastern Europe at the time, as encouraging peasant settlers was no longer considered as necessary at it had been in earlier centuries. The Privilege defined Polish serfdom for the next century, before it gradually declined under the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After nearly three centuries, the state's attitude would reverse into constitutional state protection for all peasants."
 fee_POL.17.a: "Serfdom is the way of the future!"
 fee_POL.17.b: "We can't give these predatory nobles more power."
 fee_POL.18.t: "The Prussian Homage"
 fee_POL.18.d: "Hołd pruski was the investment of the former Grand Master of the Teutonic Order as Duke of Prussia under the Polish crown. \nPoland required every new Grand Master of the Order to pay homage to the king, and a refusal to do so had resulted in lasting conflict between the Order and Poland, culminating in the Polish-Teutonic War. The war dragged on, and with renewed incursions of the Ottomans into Christian lands, the two states agreed to an armistice that would see the Teutonic Order secularised into a Polish dukedom. In the main square of Krakow, Albert publicly resigned as Grand Master before receiving the title Duke of Prussia from King Zygmunt the Old."
 fee_POL.18.a: "Establish Prussia as a royal fief."
 fee_POL.18.b: "The Order serves our purpose."
 fee_POL.19.t: "Tumult of Danzig"
 fee_POL.19.d: "The Tumult gdanski was a 1525 revolt by Lutheran burghers against the mayor of Danzig, Eberhard Ferber. The mayor was suspected of defrauding money from the city under the protection of the Crown Chancellor. As the revolt developed it took on a religious tone, and even though the mayor resigned, the refusal of the Chancellor to show the city accounts meant that riots continued. \nThe Protestant burghers closed Catholic churches and introduced their own preachers to replace pastors. As the city came under their control, the commoners demanded the removal of the city from the juridistiction of the local bishop, and a delegation sent to Martin Luther asked the priest to send teachers of the new faith. \nHowever, a year after the tumult started and two months after the burghers had seized complete control of the city, King Sigismund and the prince of Pommerania led an army into the city, putting down the revolt and beheading its leaders, restoring the old order to Danzig."
 fee_POL.19.a: "These people must be stopped at all costs!"
 fee_POL.19.b: "Live and let live."
 fee_POL.2.t: "The Treaty of Vilnius"
 fee_POL.2.d: "The Pakt wileñski was concluded between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Livonian Confederation in 1561, during the Livonian War. With the exception of the Free Imperial City of Riga, the Treaty brought all the Livonian states that were not occupied by Denmark or Sweden under the suzerainty of the Commonwealth. It also secularised the Livonian Order into the Duchy of Courland and Semigalla and the Duchy of Livonia. \nWhile the treaty finally lost Livonia its independence, in the eyes of the Polish state it rescued the Livonian lands from Russian aggression and inevitable conquest."
 fee_POL.2.a: "Incorporate Livonia, for their own good."
 fee_POL.2.b: "We don't have the capacity to administer those lands."
 fee_POL.21.t: "Karnkowski's Statute"
 fee_POL.21.d: "Statut karnkowskiego was a law enacted in 1570 by Stanislav Karnkowski, the bishop of Kujawy and Great Secretary of the Crown. The law gave the Polish king full authority over all matters of the sea, with the intention of improving Poland's naval capabilities in the Baltic Sea. The act led to extensive naval development in Danzig, but had no great effect beyond that due to the death of king Sigismund II August died, and the fact that his successor had little interest in competing for naval supremacy."
 fee_POL.21.a: "Expand the rights of the king."
 fee_POL.21.b: "We don't need this."
 fee_POL.22.t: "The Prussian Homage"
 fee_POL.22.d: "The Prussian Homage was the investment of the former Grand Master of the Teutonic Order as the duke of the secularised Ducal Prussia, a fief under the Polish Crown. \nThis fit well with Albert of Prussia's newfound Protestantism, as it allowed Prussia to no longer be a subject of the papacy. \nIt seems that our overlord has similarly decided that it is time we came properly under their wing as a secular duchy."
 fee_POL.22.a: "Humble before the Polish King."
 fee_POL.23.t: "The Treaty of Vilnius"
 fee_POL.23.d: "The Pakt wileñski was concluded between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Livonian Confederation in 1561, during the Livonian War. With the exception of the Free Imperial City of Riga, the Treaty brought all the Livonian states that were not occupied by Denmark or Sweden under the suzerainty of the Commonwealth. It also secularised the Livonian Order into the Duchy of Courland and Semigalla and the Duchy of Livonia. \nWhile the treaty finally lost Livonia its independence, in the eyes of the Polish state it rescued the Livonian lands from Russian aggression and inevitable conquest."
 fee_POL.23.a: "Poland can protect us."
 fee_POL.23.b: "We are stronger on our own!"
