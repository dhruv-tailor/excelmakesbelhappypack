 gen_roman_diplomacy_title: "Roman Diplomacy"
 gen_roman_diplomacy_desc: "At the same time, there was also a Genoese expansion on the trade routes of the Byzantine Mediterranean. In fact, the Fourth Crusade broke the traditional cooperation between Venice and the Byzantine Empire. With the Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261 the Greek Empire allied itself with Genoa against Venice, and consequently granted to the Compagna Communis and to Genoese families and companies many bases, guaranteeing them a quasi-monopoly of trade in the Black Sea."
 gen_urbs_custoditas_deo_title: "Urbs Custoditas Deo"
 gen_urbs_custoditas_deo_desc: "The Genoese colonies on the Bosphorus were few but important. The most important was the neighborhood of Galata and Pera, beyond the Golden Horn. \"Galata\" and \"Pera\" are almost synonymous expressions, but sometimes used in pairs: \"Galata and Pera\". By its nature close to the city of Constantinople but outside its walls and indeed separated by the Golden Horn, this urban area was intended for the \"Franks\" that is to the Latin Christians, mostly Genoese and Venetians, and enjoyed administrative autonomy, as it was managed by the consuls of the two Republics. Galata was Genoese since 1273. \nThe neighborhood is dominated by the Galata Tower, rebuilt by the Genoese as the Tower of Christ after the Fourth Crusade and survived to the present day. \nFurthermore, within the walls of Constantinople, but in front of Galata, there was a Genoese district, which, moreover, did not enjoy any autonomy."
 gen_reign_in_crimea_title: "Reign in Crimea"
 gen_reign_in_crimea_desc: "In the peninsula of Crimea, Caffa and other nearby towns in the hands of the Republic of Genoa were the point of contact between the Mongol-Tatar world and that of Western Europe. For over two centuries and until the complete Ottoman conquest of the Byzantine Empire, the Genoese colonies of the Black Sea prospered and enriched Genoa. \nThe Mongol conquerors of the Pontic–Caspian steppe were promoters of religious freedom, and the Genoese occupation of southern Crimea (1315+) saw rising degrees of Jewish settlement in the region. The Jewish community was divided among those who prayed according to the Sephardi, Ashkenazi and Romaniote rites. The different traditions were united into a distinctive Krymchak prayer book, which represented the Romaniote rite by Rabbi Moshe Ha-Golah, a Chief Rabbi of Kiev, who had settled in Crimea."
 gen_river_don_title: "The River Don"
 gen_river_don_desc: "In the 13th century it became an important starting point for trade from Western to Central Asia, and vice versa, and together with Trebizond it was the arrival point of the great Venetian Mude, there was a Venetian quarter and the importance of the place for trade it was strategic, there was also a small Genoese settlement, but the latter preferred the emporiums of Crimea. The representatives of the Western communities (the Franks) paid homage and paid the protection and the terratico (a rent) to the Khans of the Golden Horde who resided in Sarai. The ethnic composition was very varied, there were in addition to the Latins (Franks), Greeks (Romei), Armenians, Turks, Russians, Arabs and above all Tatars and belonging to numerous minor tribes.

The outpost and the castle persisted in the following years so that the Genoese were about half of the population, and a Genoese community, both Genoese and Italian, was registered."
 gen_port_panama_title: "Port of Panama"
 gen_port_panama_desc: "Since the sixteenth century, the Genoese controlled the port of Panama, the first port on the Pacific founded by the conquest of the Americas; the Genoese obtained a concession to exploit the port mainly for the New World slave trade in the Pacific."

 gen_genoese_colonies_title: "Genoese Colonies"
 gen_genoese_colonies_desc: "The Greek Aegean islands Chios and Mytilene became the center of Genoese trade to the East. The island of Chios, in particular, first became a fief of the Zaccaria, who established their lordship there, then it was the rich possession of a powerful Genoese family, the Giustiniani, who managed to control and keep it Christian, with contempt in front of the Turkish domination. \nThe colony of Pera, in front of Constantinople, was the central pivot of this system of Genoese colonies, which had bases in Bessarabia and Crimea as well as in Anatolia (in Trebizond) and in Abkhazia (Pitsunda). But also within the walls of Constantinople there was a Genoese quarter."
 gen_theodoro_title: "Theodoran Coast"

 gen_levant_trade_title: "The Levant Trade"
 gen_levant_trade_desc: "After the fall of Acri in 1291 the importance of Cyprus as the main exchange point between East and West has never been clear. \nThe entire wealth of the East will come in Antioch and seek a passage for the rich cities in the rest of Europe, shall we be able to regain control over Limassol, our rightful territory since 1373 we may be able to destroy the grip of the vicious Doge on the trade of the Eastern Mediterranean and regaining full control on the enormous wealth travelling from Asia to Europe."
 gen_wealth_orient_title: "Wealth of Orient"
 gen_wealth_orient_desc: "The conquest of Cyprus has unlocked the door for the trade with the wonders that lies in the Middle East, the wonders of the east: silks and oriental spices like pepper, cinnamon, salt, ginger, all will have to stop on the shores of the Mediterranean awaiting safe passage from there to Europe, shouldn't our ships be the one that will bring it? Laiazzo, Antiochia, Aleppo and the other important cities on the coasts of Asia which will provide a safe harbour for our goods."
 gen_traders_steppes_title: "Traders of the Steppes"
 gen_traders_steppes_desc: "Our market penetration in the Steppes lying North of Crimea has diminished lately since the advent of the new sultanate and the loss of our most valued fortress in the region. Whilst we still are not strong enough to directly dominate these desolate and vast lands there are two new local lords which, by being our brothers in faith or due to their ancestors' tradition of trade protection, may be interested into our offering for a renewed commercial agreement."
 gen_westward_title: "Westward"

 gen_another_route_india_title: "Another Route for India"
 gen_another_route_india_desc: "In the 15th century, some attempts at economic penetration were also attempted in Saharan Africa, such as the journey of Antonio Malfante who was sent to Tamantit by the Genoese economic elite in search of new markets. \nAfter this ruinous attempt to travel across the barren lands of Africa we may establish a sea route to reach the the cost of ivory and slave."
 gen_cape_good_hope_title: "Cape of Good Hope"
 gen_cape_good_hope_desc: "The Portuguese were the first to think about it, to look for another way to dominate the spice trade, but without our explorers they found nothing but failure. And now we are here, thanks to the knowledge of Antonio and our naval superiority we have found a new way to get to India, this cape will be of good hope."
 gen_spice_venture_title: "Spice's Venture"
 gen_spice_venture_desc: "\"At the German fair in Venice there are no more big deals. The Germans did not want to buy at the current high prices and the Venetian merchants did not want to lower them due to the scarce quantity of spices in Venice. There were less than 250 shipments of pepper in the city. , 384 tons of ginger, 7 of nutmeg and 7 of cloves ... nobody remembered ever having less.\" We managed to overwhelm Venice, while they are damned looking for an agreement with pagan sultans we have discovered how to reach the Indies via the huge ocean."
 gen_traders_asia_title: "Traders of Asia"
 gen_traders_asia_desc: "The first full-scale conflict between Genoa and Venice arose from a dispute over prerogatives in Acre, which led to a Genoese attack on the Venetian quarter. The Venetians were supported by the Pisans and Provencals, the Knights Templar and some of the local nobility, while the Catalans, Anconitans, Knights Hospitaller and other local nobles joined the Genoese. A fleet sent from Venice under Lorenzo Tiepolo in 1257 defeated a Genoese fleet off Acre when it arrived in June the next year. \nCenturies after we laugh over the claims of the Doge and those low level infamous that call themselves merchants. While they were focusing so much on the Mediterranean routes we were able to establish a direct and safe route until India, finally channelling all the spices in the safest port of the world, the one of Zena!"

 gen_mighty_fleet_title: "A Mighty Fleet"
 gen_mighty_fleet_desc: "The Republic for centuries did not endow itself with a permanent fleet, the maintenance of which would have constituted a very heavy burden. The galleys belonged to private individuals, who made them available in case of war. Likewise, Genoa was able to gather numerous fleets in a short time, such as the 88 galleys in Meloria or the 85 in Curzola. The Republic was responsible for regulating all matters. \nThe first rules in this regard date back to the mid-fourteenth century - the rules of Gazaria, ancient name of the Crimea - which deal precisely with the galleys used for trade with the colonies on the Black Sea. The rules of Gazaria is one of the oldest sources of maritime law in Europe."
 gen_doge_dominion_title: "The Doge's Dominion"
 gen_doge_dominion_desc: "On the Venetian front, the Adriatic area, squeezed between the Marca (especially with reference to Ancona) and the Apulian coast to the west and the myriad of islands and archipelagos of the eastern Adriatic where Venice stood out. Venice traces routes that lead to the Greek archipelagos, capable of favoring coastal shipping: from the Ionian islands (with Corfu as a north-western pillar) to the two strongholds of Modone and Corone, which controlled entry and transit between the Ionian and Aegean seas (Oi dio ophalmoi tis Galinotatis, the two eyes of the Serenissima); then Crete, the largest island in the eastern Mediterranean and of utmost importance for the North-South connections to the Aegean; the insidious Cyclades towards the Dardanelles and Constantinople; finally the Dodecanese, opposite the Anatolian peninsula and the access belt to Cyprus and the Levantine and North African coasts."

Their galleys will no more sail the seas without our approval, their sailors will no longer feel the breeze of the waves if not for working on our ships, La Superba is eternal."
 gen_italian_trade_title: "Italian Trade"
 gen_italian_trade_desc: "The foreign policy of the Republic of Genoa, from the dawn of the year one thousand and along the slow running of the Middle Ages, up to the threshold of the modern era, was mainly that of guaranteeing citizens - outside the borders of Genoa and in projection of overseas territories - a dense network of merchant routes. \nIt was pursued by a consolidated ruling class, at the same time as pragmatic as it was aware of itself and its power. This policy was mainly based on the acquisition and control of new territories - which later became the so-called Genoese colonies - but also on the simple presence in the port cities located along the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea and outside it."

 gen_trading_egypt_desc: "When the Fatimidh's were ruling as the Sultan of Egypt our colonies in the cities of Alexandira, El Cairo and Tolemaide were prosperous, reach and respected, christians and muslims could come and go as they pleased. \nThese barbarics heatens have ruined our efforts for the last time, we shall seek to restore a safe passage for pilgrims in and out of the Egypt, and profit from the trade of our chestnuts, Sultan's delight."
 gen_mare_nostrum_title: "Mare Nostrum"
 gen_mare_nostrum_desc: "In Europe as in Africa or Asia, sometimes also with significant presences in the interior areas, in the fairs and in the most important financial centers of the world then frequented and frequented, sometimes going into unexplored or unknown lands, the Genoese laid the foundations of a economic and commercial empire, now with the weapons of diplomacy, now with the galleys of the Republic or its citizens. \nFrom Alexandria to Valencia, none dares challenge our Merchants. Our Republic has beaten the odds and has emerged victorious on all fronts. Glory to us! Long live our Republic!"
 gen_nice_title: "Nice"
 gen_nice_desc: "Our neighbors in Savoy do not acctively participate in trade as we do, and thus have no need for the por city of Niza. We should take if off of their hands for the benefit of both nations, solidifying our hold in Northern Italy and relieving them of the burdern of governance."

 gen_conquest_of_rome_desc: "Founded according to tradition on April 21, 753 BC (although recent excavations in Lapis niger would date the foundation back to 2 centuries earlier), during its three millennia of history it was the first metropolis of humanity, the beating heart of one of the most important ancient civilizations, which influenced society, the culture, language, literature, art, architecture, philosophy, religion, law and customs of the following centuries. Place of origin of the Latin language, it was the capital of the Roman Empire which extended its dominion over the whole Mediterranean basin and most of Europe, the Papal States, subjected to the temporal power of the popes and the future Kingdom of Italy. By definition, Rome, Caput Mundi and Eternal City are defined. Its historic center, delimited by the perimeter of the Aurelian walls, overlapping of testimonies of almost three millennia, is an expression of the historical, artistic and cultural heritage of the western European world."

 gen_tyrrenean_hegemony_desc: "Extending from our City to the Island of Sicily the Tyrrhenian Sea is our most vital outlet for trade, and although the victory in the Battle of Meloria against the Pisan fleets has shown our clear hegemony over anyone that dared question our rightful ruling, new foreign powers, such as the Spanyards, have tried reaching out their fingers to dip them into the reaches of this trade, we shall show them clearly who's fleet is superior."
 gen_take_back_whats_ours_title: "Take Back What's Ours"
 gen_take_back_whats_ours_desc: "The first overseas expansion of Genoa was in Corsica, annexed to the Genoese Republic in 1284, and in north-western Sardinia. The battle of Meloria marked the definitive defeat of the Republic of Pisa by the Genoese, who annexed Corsica. In those years, entire Ligurian-speaking villages were transplanted to Corsica (mainly in Bonifacio and Calvi) and still partially characterize the island from an ethnic-linguistic point of view. In Sardinia Sassari became a confederate commune to the Genoese republic in 1294; always in the north-west of the island settled the Doria, who boasted some kinship ties with the judges of Torres, who founded centers such as Alghero and Castelgenovese."

 gen_la_superba_desc: "Respublica superiorem non recognoscens \nWe come to Genoa, which you say you have never seen. You will see a royal city, leaning against an alpine hill, superb for men and for walls, whose appearance alone indicates the lady of the sea; its very power, as has already happened to many cities, harms them and causes them damage, because it offers material to the disputes and jealousies of the city."
 gen_merchant_army_title: "Merchant Army"
 gen_merchant_army_desc: "Sometimes, in order to do business, one needs to carry some heft to their blows. Essentially, we need an army or our national sovereignty may be in jeopardy.

 gen_anziani_ruling_desc: "In the distant 1284 in Meloria, the Pisan and Genoese fleets clashed for the last time, a battle that marked the end of the republic of the Elders and our definite rise to power in the Tyrrhenian hegemony. \nDespite everything, Pisa was not definitively defeated, not even when our best admiral Corrado Doria razed the port, and is now under the protection of [115.Owner.GetName]. Dominion in the Tyrrhenian Sea cannot be hindered by a simple town that does not decide to remain in its rightful place."
 gen_tyrrenean_islands_title: "Tyrrenean Islands"
 gen_tyrrenean_islands_desc: "In 1295, Pope Boniface VIII intervened to try to resolve the Corsican question, who sanctioned the birth of the Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica in the Treaty of Anagni, which he handed over to King James II of Aragon (meanwhile engaged in the Reconquista in Spain). Corsica was thus merged with the Aragonese Dominions. The Aragonese actually settled in the newborn kingdom only in 1324, focusing exclusively on Sardinia, without ever actually administering Corsica. \nCorsica is therefore still the victim of a substantial power vacuum that will last a good 63 years overall. The issue was resolved only in 1347 thanks to the Corsican baron Sambucuccio d'Alando, who convened an assembly of all the barons and corporals of the island. The assembly will decide to detach itself definitively from Aragon and place itself under the protection of Genoa, offering the Ligurian Republic total sovereignty on the island."

 gen_bona_tabarca_desc: "Following the ever growing threat of Berber raids, the Republic of Genoa annexed the island of Tabarka off the coast of Tunisia bordering Algeria, entrusted to the Genoese Lomellini family. \nSome descendants of these Ligurians transplanted to Tabarca to exploit the local coral also moved to Tunis and Biserta, where they were among the first Italian-Tunisians in contemporary Tunisia (and subsequently founded the colony of Carloforte on the island of San Pietro and Calasetta in the 'Island of Sant'Antioco in Sardinia and Nueva Tabarka in Spain)."
 gen_art_sculture_title: "Art and Sculture"
 gen_art_sculture_desc: "The chapel of San Giovanni Battista is a vast and rich side room of the left aisle of the cathedral of San Lorenzo in Genoa. It was commissioned by the Confraternity of San Giovanni Battista starting from 1448 to house the relics of the patron saint of the city, which, according to tradition, had been brought from Mira, in Asia Minor, to Genoa in 1098 - 1099 by Guglielmo Embriaco. \nThe structure was designed and built between 1450 and 1460 by Domenico Gagini da Bissone, a Ticino sculptor who was a pupil of Filippo Brunelleschi, who worked on it together with his nephew Elia Gagini. \n\"I arrived at Santa Maria di Carignano, located on a hill, through a large bridge with numerous arches, launched, for the convenience of passers-by, over several streets with eight-story houses. ... It is a simple and noble architecture, all white. \nFour large statues adorn the transept. San Sebastiano del Puget is the best among them. As for the paintings, I want to remember a Magdalene by Guido, a Martyr by Carlo Maratta, a San Francesco del Guercino, a Deposition from the cross of Cambiaso, a San Carlo di Piola and a San Domenico del Sarzana. \nWe went up the dome by a spiral staircase, which however has no central column, since, instead of this, there is a large cylindrical hole from the bottom to the top. From the top of the dome you can enjoy a very extensive view of both the sea and the city.\""

 ME_Genoa_Events.4.T: "The Steppe's traders"
 ME_Genoa_Events.4.D: "To facilitate trade, Genghis offered protection for merchants who began to come from east and west. He also offered a higher status for merchants than that allowed by the Chinese or Persians who despised trade and traders. .During the Mongol Empire, merchants found protection, status, tax exemption, loans and consistent aid from the Khans. For the 100 years of the height of the Empire, the East-West Mongol trade routes became the fabled Silk Road which for the first time linked Europe to Asia, allowing the free flow of ideas, technologies and goods. \nAfter the fall of his empire, our merchants are still welcomed in the court of the Khan in the East, but a new power has risen, a power of our christian brethern, maybe we should seek agreement with the Grand Prince instead?"

 ME_Genoa_Events.5.OPT2: "Never, the money is ours"

 ME_Genoa_Events.6.T: "The Silk Road"
 ME_Genoa_Events.6.D: "The final destination of the silk that traveled on it (certainly not alone but together with many other precious goods) was Rome, where, moreover, it was not known precisely what its origin was (whether animal or vegetable) and where it came from . Other equally precious goods traveled in reverse, and great ideas and religions (fundamentals of mathematics, geometry, astronomy) traveled in both directions together with the goods; Manichaeism towards the west, Nestorianism towards the east. Buddhism also made a complex round trip on the Silk Road, from India to Central Asia to China and finally to Tibet (all to find routes that would allow you to avoid the almost impassable mountains of the Himalayas). \nThe expansion of the Mongol Empire throughout the Asian continent from about 1215 to 1360 gave economic stability to the large area and re-established the importance of the Silk Road as an extraordinary means of communication between East and West, even if silk has been for several centuries, already produced in Europe itself, was of little importance. Between 1325 and 1354, a great Moroccan Muslim traveler, Ibn Battuta, came to travel in the Crimea and the present Middle East, continuing to the Mongol principalities of the heirs of Genghis Khan, of which he left very lively descriptions. In the third quarter of the 13th century, Marco Polo told in Il Milione that he had reached China and the court of the Mongol emperor-conqueror Kublai Khan, of whom he would become a trusted adviser. Like him (and in several cases before him) numerous Christian missionaries traveled on those paths such as William of Rubruck, Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, Andrea di Longjumeau, Odorico da Pordenone, Giovanni de 'Marignolli, Giovanni di Monte Corvino, Niccolò Da Conti. \nWith the disintegration of the Mongol Empire and its Mongolian pax, the Silk Road lost its political, cultural and economic uniqueness, returning to shatter under the dominions of local principalities essentially of nomadic origin, which drew their wealth from the extortion of traders that they had to cross their lands and from the kidnapping of travelers to be sold as slaves on their markets. The Mongols had reduced lords like those of Samarkand, Bukhara and Khiva to reason, but the heirs of the latter returned to impose their devastating and retrograde empire. Furthermore, after the expulsion of the Mongolian dynasty of the Yuan, China had closed in on itself, preventing access to all foreigners, including Westerners, already favored by the hated Mongols. \nWe could seek contact with the owner of the most important cities in the Middle East."
