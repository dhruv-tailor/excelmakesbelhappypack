 # Missions:
 ME_HUN_regQuestion_mission_title: "The Regency Question"
 ME_HUN_regQuestion_mission_desc: "Missing ashes shine alight as the Kingdom grieves over her missing king. Władysław III had grand ambitions upon which rested the hopes of Hungary, but with his death at the hands of the Turks, all that remains is a forlorn husk in need of a ruler. Though the reign of Ladislaus V is sure to be fruitful, we must first see to the election of a regent capable of defending Hungary 'gainst the looming threat."
 ME_HUN_newAdmin_mission_title: "A new Administration"
 ME_HUN_newAdmin_mission_desc: "The state of Hungarian governance has never been truly stable, passing between numerous dynasties in grand and terrible succession wars. The Angevins, Luxembourgs, Habsburgs, and Jagiellons have all sat upon our throne, yet none have been truly Hungarian. We must settle these succession issues once and for all."
 ME_HUN_austrianQuestion_mission_title: "The Austrian Question"
 ME_HUN_austrianQuestion_mission_desc: "The Duchy of Austria has long since exerted influence over our great kingdom, with several of our rulers chosen from the Habsburg line. For two nations to have such strong dynastic ties and remain separate is practically unheard of. The Poles seek union in the north, thus it is only right for us to do the same."
 ME_HUN_hreDom_mission_title: "Holy Roman Dominance"
 ME_HUN_hreDom_mission_desc: "With the Austrians firmly out of the picture, the Empire's gates lie open for our valorant army to march into the heart of Germany. For too long has the Emperor exerted [Emperor.GetHerHis] influence on our great kingdom. For each transgression, we shall repay them a thousand times over."
 ME_HUN_bibloCorvia_mission_title: "Bibliotheca Corviana"
 ME_HUN_bibloCorvia_mission_desc: "With the re-emergence of Classical knowledge and the boost that this has given to our scientists and philosophers, we would be well-served by the establishment of a library where Europe's accumulated knowledge can be stored."
 ME_HUN_nagyUniver_mission_title: "Nagyszombat University"
 ME_HUN_nagyUniver_mission_desc: "We should establish a center of religious and secular learning, where the next generation of thinkers who will support the growth of our nation will be nurtured."
 ME_HUN_quellHussite_mission_title: "Quell the Hussites"
 ME_HUN_quellHussite_mission_desc: "The annual raids of Slovakia by the militant Bohemian Hussites have gone on for too long. With the attention of Europe firmly placed on the Hussites' rise to power in Bohemia, we are fully within our rights to invade to put an end to this madness."
 ME_HUN_safeBohemia_mission_title: "Safeguard Bohemia"
 ME_HUN_safeBohemia_mission_desc: "Austrian diplomatic policy has recently taken the form of dynastic maneuvering in an attempt to place Habsburg monarchs on as many thrones as possible. We would be a poor neighbor to Bohemia to allow such a tragic happening to occur."
 ME_HUN_masterAxes_mission_title: "Master of Two Axes"
 ME_HUN_masterAxes_mission_desc: "All earth aligns upon the two axes of north and south, as well as east and west. Through trial and tribulation, we have become instrumental to both, directing the affairs of Germany and the Balkans as we see fit. All that remains is ensuring the continued administration of these lands from our capital in [Root.Capital.GetName]."
 ME_HUN_supportMon_mission_title: "Support Monastaries"
 ME_HUN_supportMon_mission_desc: "The Pauline Order has been influential in Hungary since its foundation by the Blessed Eusebius of Esztergom in 1250 and has even spread to neighboring countries. Setting aside funds to ensure their goodwill towards the state would be a sound investment."
 ME_HUN_grandBuda_mission_title: "Grand Buda"
 ME_HUN_grandBuda_mission_desc: "One of the three great cities of Hungary, Buda represents our capital and seat of government. As such, it is the very core and crux of our country. We cannot let its glory be overshadowed by the nearby urban centers of Vienna and Prague. Let us put in the proper blood and toil to ensure its grandeur remains plain as day."
 ME_HUN_transSchism_mission_title: "Transylvanian Schism"
 ME_HUN_transSchism_mission_desc: "Though religious minorities exist throughout central Hungary, nowhere do they make a greater presence of themselves than Transylvania. The Council of Florence has proved futile in its attempts at a united Papal structure, thus we must continue the work of Louis I and seek unification from within."
 ME_HUN_ruthIssue_mission_title: "The Ruthenian Issue"
 ME_HUN_ruthIssue_mission_desc: "Máramaros represents a particularly troublesome crown province. Its people, despite pledging allegiance to the Hungarian crown, refuse to accept neither the Hungarian faith nor way of life. Separatism must be stifled, one way or another, to achieve national hegemony."
 ME_HUN_carpatUnity_mission_title: "Carpathian Unity"
 ME_HUN_carpatUnity_mission_desc: "Despite centuries of hardship and strife, the Kingdom of Hungary remains triumphant in its rightful conquests. One last quest remains: the unification of the Carpathian Mountains awaits, both politically and spiritually."
 ME_HUN_jagUnion_mission_title: "Jagiellonian Union"
 ME_HUN_jagUnion_mission_desc: "The succession of Hungary, though temporarily stable, has historically been somewhat troublesome. Foreign nobles often vied for the throne, and no such noble was more influential in Hungary than Władysław III. Bringing Hungary into a war we couldn't win, he managed to leave the nation in a far worse state than he gained it. It is clear a Polish-led union cannot survive, thus we shall assert ourselves as the head of the next one."
 ME_HUN_hunAscend_mission_title: "Hungary Ascendant"
 ME_HUN_hunAscend_mission_desc: "The Hungarian Empire has asserted itself as the primary power of Eastern Europe, duelling the Turks and Germans alike, always ending up victorious. Never has history gazed upon such a magnificant display of might."
 ME_HUN_polRelations_mission_title: "Polish Relations"
 ME_HUN_polRelations_mission_desc: "The recent departure of our joint monarch has left most in our nation seeking a break-off of relations from Poland. Indeed, the Poles seem inclined to appoint a Lithuanian king. Despite this, a ressurection of past glory may still be possible."
 ME_HUN_romaQuestion_mission_title: "The Romanian Question"
 ME_HUN_romaQuestion_mission_desc: "The Duchies of Wallachia and Moldavia remain in a precarious position as buffer states between the greater Christian Europe and the malevolent Turks. Should they remain so woefully undefended, the Danube might yet fall."
 ME_HUN_warEurope_mission_title: "European Defense"
 ME_HUN_warEurope_mission_desc: "The time has come to stand against those vile Turks that seek our demise. We stand for all of Christendom, nay, all of Europe in our strike. Just as a sword must be tempered by flame, our resolve has merely been bolstered beneath the weight of turmoil."
 ME_HUN_avengeVarna_mission_title: "Avenge Varna"
 ME_HUN_avengeVarna_mission_desc: "The Turkic menace has merely grown stronger since our own defeat at the Battle of Varna. Such a monumental occasion has dictated our foreign policy to this point, driving us to create a state capable of standing againt their relentless onslaught. We may only match such strength with our own tenacity."
 ME_HUN_bulEconomy_mission_title: "A Bullion Economy"
 ME_HUN_bulEconomy_mission_desc: "Hungary hosts one of the largest silver mines of Europe in villa Baka, yet we continue to relegate ourselves to foreign currency. Our economy continues to utilize the florentinus for most forms of commerce, a state of affairs that leaves our monetary policy susceptible to Italian influence. We have the means to alter this situation, it is simply a matter of will."
 ME_HUN_danDev_mission_title: "Danubian Development"
 ME_HUN_danDev_mission_desc: "Along the Danube River lies the core of our nation and the Hungarian people of old. It is fertile land, ripe for urbanization. As such, it is our duty to bring these towns under our wing and foster new urban areas."
 ME_HUN_balkanSecurity_mission_title: "Balkan Security"
 ME_HUN_balkanSecurity_mission_desc: "After the return of Belgrade to us in 1427, relations with the Serbians have hit an all-time low. The status quo has shifted, and we must be prepared to seize the initiative and exert our influence over our southward buffer state."
 ME_HUN_revokeBuffer_mission_title: "Revoke the Buffer"
 ME_HUN_revokeBuffer_mission_desc: "Serbia merely exists as a buffer state at the permission of the Turks. This is a grave insult to both Serbian and Hungarian pride. The people of Eastern Europe are not so easily trifled with!"
 ME_HUN_blackArmy_mission_title: "The Black Army"
 ME_HUN_blackArmy_mission_desc: "With strong neighbors on all sides the Hungarian Kingdom has often had a need for a strong army. In wars past our nobles have supplied most of our armed forces with mercenary bands hired to complement their forces. Soldiers by occupation, these mercenaries are often quick to adopt new weapons and tactics and will generally have training that few levies can compete with. Some have now served us for years and in times of peace turn to banditry to make a living. Inspired by the writings of Julius Caesar, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has begun to entertain the idea of a permanent professional army. Providing a permanent source of income for soldiers would undoubtedly deter them from banditry and could give us a force of unparalleled strength. At least if our our finances can support it..."
 ME_HUN_mountMount_mission_title: "Mountain to Mountain"
 ME_HUN_mountMount_mission_desc: "With our recent conquests in the Balkans, we find ourselves in the perfect position to act as a barrier preventing further Ottoman expansion into Europe. The fall of Greece was the final straw; we shall stretch from the Carpathians to Balkans!"
 ME_HUN_fiscalReform_mission_title: "Fiscal Reform"
 ME_HUN_fiscalReform_mission_desc: "Our revised monetary policy has allowed further minting of bullion ducats, though the feudal mess of expenditure and debt we find ourselves in can hardly be called a solved problem. We require full control over the kingdom's expenditure if we wish to solve this financial chaos"
 ME_HUN_fosterCroa_mission_title: "Foster Croatia"
 ME_HUN_fosterCroa_mission_desc: "As the rightful ruler of Croatia, it is Hungary's rightful duty to ensure the continuous growth of the Croat peoples in our long-held southern territories. Such a feat would surely bring the lands closer to true integration with the Hungarian Crown."

 # Events
 ME_Hungary_Events.1: "Establishment of the Black Army"
 ME_Hungary_Events.1_t: "Establishment of the Black Army"
 ME_Hungary_Events.1_d: "The Black Army protects the @HUN Kingdom of Hungary from foes on all sides - it is the shield and sword with which Hungary operates. However, a standing army is no easy task to upkeep. Hopefully, our coffers will manage - otherwise, no glory after all to the Black Army."
 ME_Hungary_Events.1_o1: "Forward, Fekete Sereg!"

 ME_Hungary_Events.2_t: "Disbanding the Black Army"
 ME_Hungary_Events.2_d: "Our coffers could manage it no more.. The Black Army lives, but it is negligible now.. Goodbye, Fekete Sereg!"
 ME_Hungary_Events.2_o1: "Goodbye, Fekete Sereg!"

 ME_Hungary_Events.5_t: "The Hungarian Challenge"
 ME_Hungary_Events.5_d: "The Hungarians have issued an ultimatum. In response to the recent Hussite raids on Slovakia, they assert that the Bohemian crown rightfully belongs to [HUN.Ruler.GetName], [HUN.Ruler.GetTitle] of Hungary. They have the backing of the Pope and the odds are slim that the Emperor shall aid us in our struggles. How shall we proceed?"
 ME_Hungary_Events.5_o1: "We'll give them a fight!"
 ME_Hungary_Events.5_o2: "By the Lord... concede to their demands."

 ME_Hungary_Events.6_t: "Diplomatic Crisis"
 ME_Hungary_Events.6_d: "Despite our grand denouncement of Bohemian heresy, we have failed to act upon our words. The world laughs at our inaction, and we lack a proper rebuttal."
