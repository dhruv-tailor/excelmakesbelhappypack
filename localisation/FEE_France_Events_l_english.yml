 FEE_France_Events.201.OPT1: "Blame Zach"

 FEE_France_Events.1.T: "French Feudalism and the Hundred Years’ War"
 FEE_France_Events.1.D: "In many of its aspects the institution of feudalism that defined medieval European life had its origins in France. During the 11th century, however, the “French Feudal Revolution” gave French feudalism a bewildering complexity that existed nowhere else in Europe, as holdings got broken down into ever smaller parts under the emergent classes of seigneurs and castellons. Some regions, such as Toulouse, were brought to heal, but most regions remained largely ruled by small powers with little control from Paris. \n\nThe agony of the Hundred Years’ War only increased the confusion, as allegiances between the various vassals fluctuated between the Valois and Plantagenet claimants to the throne. The expense of the war left France unable to enforce feudal obligations on several more prominent vassals, but also underlined the need for centralization to mount an effective defense against foreign aggression. To truly centralize France, however, centuries of tradition, laws, and feudal contracts would, sooner or later, need to be disregarded or destroyed…"
 FEE_France_Events.1.OPT1: "We must centralize the Kingdom of France!"
 FEE_France_Events.1.OPT2: "We should remind our vassals of their military obligations!"
 FEE_France_Events.1.OPT3: "France is too vast to govern, we must preserve the feudal system!"

 FEE_France_Events.2.T: "Law Courts and Parlements"
 FEE_France_Events.2.D: "Power in France does not solely lie with the nobility, who exercise varying levels of independence from Paris. The rising class of lawyers, themselves centered in Paris, conduct much of the administration of the country with little oversight by the monarchy. Due to the inadequate road system, the further away from Paris the courts are, the less they tend to listen to the king. A properly unified administration of the nation must, of course, start here."
 FEE_France_Events.2.OPT1: "We shall reign them in by any means necessary!"
 FEE_France_Events.2.OPT2: "Let us seek to reason with them: perhaps they will help us on their own"
 FEE_France_Events.2.OPT3: "§GLet the King Himself negotiate with these men§!"

 FEE_France_Events.3.T: "Regional Identities in France"
 FEE_France_Events.3.D: "France in the early modern period was a vast and populous land: by some measures the largest and most populous realm in the Western World, and certainly the largest to be claimed by one hereditary monarch, as opposed to the elective monarchy of the more populous but divided Holy Roman Empire. Despite the greater political unity, people in the various regions of France clung to their local identities rather than considering themselves Frenchmen, especially further away from the capital."
 FEE_France_Events.3.OPT1: "It is time we create a France for the French! "
 FEE_France_Events.3.OPT2: "Let the provincials be themselves, I don’t care"

 FEE_France_Events.4.T: "Paris Seeks Control"
 FEE_France_Events.4.D: "Now that the war with England is finally over, instead of resting on their victory, it seems the French king has decided to curtail our God-given rights as local rulers and impose his own autocratic will on us. Needless to say, as semi-independent nobles in France, it falls to us to stand for the nobility across France and remind the King from whence his power comes."
 FEE_France_Events.4.OPT1: "We must send a delegation to Paris to assert our rights!"
 FEE_France_Events.4.OPT2: "There is nothing we can really do"

 FEE_France_Events.5.T: "French Feudal Lords Oppose the King"
 FEE_France_Events.5.D: "Seeking to preserve their long-standing feudal prerogatives, the nobility remains a powerful force that largely opposes the recent royal efforts at centralization. Our recent efforts at increasing royal control have caused a delegation of France’s most powerful nobles, the semi-independent vassals of the crown, and others to approach the king and demand that our course be reversed."
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT1: "Ignore them!"
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT2: "We can afford to reverse course a little"
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT3: "Let us attempt to give carrots as well as sticks"
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT4: "We must crush this arrogance now! "

 FEE_France_Events.6.T: "King Rejects our Demands"
 FEE_France_Events.6.D: "Our thinly veiled demand for protection of our rights and privileges was dismissed out-of-hand by the King in Paris. "
 FEE_France_Events.6.OPT1: "Perhaps it is time we show the king who really holds power in France…"
 FEE_France_Events.6.OPT2: "We cannot contend with the King of France"

 FEE_France_Events.7.T: "Noble Leaders Arrested!"
 FEE_France_Events.7.D: "In an unexpected turn of events, the French king has responded in the worst way possible to our demands. Arresting some leaders and having others secretly killed, most of the delegation to Paris will not be returning to their extensive land holdings any time soon…"
 FEE_France_Events.7.OPT1: "§Y[Root.Monarch.GetName]§! will rue the day!"

 FEE_France_Events.8.T: "The Second Estate"
 FEE_France_Events.8.D: "While the nobility of France keep much of the King’s attention due to their vast land holdings and military power, the clergy are equally a political force to be reckoned with. At times the French clergy have controlled upwards of 40% of the nation’s wealth in endowments that under French law could only increase, never decrease. The French Crown did, at least wrest the power to appoint bishops and cardinals during the medieval Investiture crisis, but the clergy are also a more unified force in opposition to the king than the often-squabbling nobility. If [Root.Monarch.GetName] can leverage what concessions he already has, he can overcome the clergy’s resistance to centralization. If not…"
 FEE_France_Events.8.OPT1: "Seize Clergy Land and Curtail their Influence!"
 FEE_France_Events.8.OPT2: "Negotiate to gain their support for royal power"
 FEE_France_Events.8.OPT3: "Do not disturb the clergy"

 FEE_France_Events.9.T: "Clergy Refuses!"
 FEE_France_Events.9.D: "Our attempts at negotiating with the church have been met with arrogant dismissal at the hands of the leading clergymen of the realm. Saying that “your power comes from God just as ours does,” they refuse to relinquish any of their political power in our realm. In response to our attempts to use investiture to leverage influence, they have reignited the feud between church and king over the right to appoint church officials."
 FEE_France_Events.9.OPT1: "Ingrates!"
 FEE_France_Events.9.OPT2: "This has gone far enough – the King of France rules the church!"

 FEE_France_Events.10.T: "Clergy Accepts"
 FEE_France_Events.10.D: "Our overtures were accepted by the Second Estate! Whether through respect for the divine rule of the king, or from fear of the king’s power over investiture, prominent clerics led a ceremony of reaffirmation of the French king’s authority over the church."
 FEE_France_Events.10.OPT1: "Wonderful!"
 
 FEE_France_Events.11.T: "Re-Trial of Jeanne D'Arc"
 FEE_France_Events.11.D: "In the year 1429, the Hundred years war was still raging on. With much of Northern France under the Anglo-Burgundian alliance, France was in a weak position. That same year, a peasant girl named Jeanne D'Arc, instructed by voices of angels, went into the royal court of Chinon where king Charles VII, along with many military leaders, to Orleans in order to defeat the English. In the ensuing battle, she earned the nickname 'Maid of Orleans'. Later on in her life, she helped the king be crowned at Reims, and led an unsuccessful attack to reclaim the city of Paris. In the year 1431, she was captured by the Burgundians who sold her to the English, and she was trialed and executed in the city of Rouen.\n\nNow, with the support of the Pope, the university of Paris, and the city of Rouen at our hand, the trial has been re-done, with over 115 witnesses testifying of the maid's purity. This will eliminate any claims that the kingdom was reclaim using a sorceress, thus removing any threats of undermining our legitimacy."
 FEE_France_Events.11.OPT1: "The English fops have been beaten once again."

 FEE_France_Events.12.T: "The Bourgeoisie Request Concessions"
 FEE_France_Events.12.D: "While the nobility and clergy estate have historically been the most powerful in France, the support of the bourgeoisie has always been vital to shore up royal support both within Paris, by far the largest urban center of France, and the outlying cities. The cities, which provide much of the trade wealth of France, bend the knee to neither nobles nor priests. Thus, the bourgeoisie, also known as the Third Estate, controls a disproportionate amount of the wealth that reaches the King’s coffers. \nWord of our recent efforts at tighter administration have reached the towns dominated by the Third Estate. They are worried about their rights and privileges that make their cities attractive for trade and business in the first place, and that the crown might seek to repeal them."
 FEE_France_Events.12.OPT1: "They are nothing but lowborns! We govern as we wish!"
 FEE_France_Events.12.OPT2: "We can’t do anything against them"

 FEE_France_Events.13.T: "Conflict Between King and Cities"
 FEE_France_Events.13.D: "The Third Estate has decidedly split with the royal authority in Paris over the crown’s refusal to continue guaranteeing their rights and privileges. Much of France’s small but growing urban population is now suspicious of every move the King makes that might threaten their freedoms. Their fears have caused them to seek support from the outlying dukes and princes of the French periphery. Some bourgeoisie have approached us offering financial support and men. By joining their own resources with ours, we can present a united front against any encroachment from Paris."
 FEE_France_Events.13.OPT1: "We thank them for their support!"
 FEE_France_Events.13.OPT2: "What they say is treason, enough of this!"

 FEE_France_Events.14.T: "A Regular Army"
 FEE_France_Events.14.D: "Throughout the feudal world, the social order could be simplified as “those who fought for all (the nobility), those who prayed for all (the clergy), and those who worked for all (everyone else).” In the 1400s this social order seemed as strong as ever, but in practice warfare was often much less idealistic. The strain on the feudal levies caused by the Hundred Years’ War caused the French king to rely ever more heavily on mercenaries. These ragtag armies were often poorly disciplined and cruel to the populace they were supposed to protect. \n\nIn 1445, in the aftermath of the Surrender of Maine, the first real attempt was made to reorganize the army, but mercenaries still dominated the battlefield. Those fiefs ruled directly by the Crown are more than adequate to supply a large standing army if the Crown were to institute more rigorous recruiting; however, the manpower of our vassals is not to be underestimated; nor are the consequences of demanding too much from the French peasantry in the place of mercenaries."
 FEE_France_Events.14.OPT1: "We must remind our nobles of their obligations!"
 FEE_France_Events.14.OPT2: "We can squeeze enough men from our own land"
 FEE_France_Events.14.OPT3: "We should continue relying on mercenaries"

 FEE_France_Events.15.T: "The Provencal Claims"
 FEE_France_Events.15.D: "The Dukes of Provence have proven mightily ambitious in recent years, claiming every vacant throne from Aragon to Jerusalem. When all is said and done, however, they are nothing but a mere scion of the Valois dynasty which rules France, the greatest crown in Europe outside the Emperor himself. This junior part of the family has managed to secure itself de jure French possessions far and wide, has proclaimed themselves a kingdom, and even claims as core territory land that is our own core territory! \n\nNeedless to say, the lofty ambitions of this cadet branch threaten to interfere with ours. While the Anjou princes have tried their best to maintain good relations, perhaps it is in our best interest to reconsider their alliance with us..."
 FEE_France_Events.15.OPT1: "It is time that Provence acknowledges our rule"
 FEE_France_Events.15.OPT2: "We should support our Provencal cousins, not repress them"

 FEE_France_Events.16.T: "The Breton Question"
 FEE_France_Events.16.D: "While the Bretons were included in the old Carolingian Empire, the last bastion of Celtic presence in mainland Europe was quick to regain it’s independence. Gifted with deft diplomats, they negotiated our respect for their sovereignty in exchange for neutrality in the Hundred Years’ War. Now that the English have been evicted from France, however, this promise of neutrality is no longer relevant. More relevant is the promise of the treaty that Brittany will swear fealty and tribute to the rightful King of France. \n\nTreaty or not, the fact remains that the Bretons occupy land that is rightfully part of the French crown. Whether we choose to act on our legal rights, however, depends on the diplomatic consequences of doing so."
 FEE_France_Events.16.OPT1: "The Bretons must bend the knee to us!"
 FEE_France_Events.16.OPT2: "We must at least receive our rightful tribute"
 FEE_France_Events.16.OPT3: "We have no need of land in Brittany, if they want it they can have it."

 FEE_France_Events.17.T: "France Demands Tribute"
 FEE_France_Events.17.D: "In the Second Treaty of Guerande, we managed to stave off French attempts at annexing us by promising both neutrality in the Hundred Years’ War and swearing a nominal fealty to France. Now, envoys from Paris have arrived, claiming that fealty be given. While not an overt demand at subjugation or annexation, it is a claim of overlordship and demand for tribute that weighs seriously on [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s mind. Furthermore, the envoys of Paris claim that tribute must be paid, not only for this year but all the years since the treaty was signed over two generations ago."
 FEE_France_Events.17.OPT1: "We have no choice but to accept"
 FEE_France_Events.17.OPT2: "We are independent and owe nothing to France!"

 FEE_France_Events.18.T: "Brittany Accepts"
 FEE_France_Events.18.D: "True to their word, the Duke of Brittany has agreed to pay in full the tribute that he owes us!"
 FEE_France_Events.18.OPT1: "Excellent! We need nothing more from them."

 FEE_France_Events.19.T: "Brittany Refuses"
 FEE_France_Events.19.D: "Valuing their precious coin above their sacred oaths, the Bretons have refuse to pay us tribute!"
 FEE_France_Events.19.OPT1: "They will pay us, one way or another!"

 FEE_France_Events.20.T: "Scottish Mercenaries"
 FEE_France_Events.20.D: "The ties between Scotland and France by 1444 were deep. In addition to the Auld Alliance, Scots have been travelling to France to serve as fighters in the relatively lucrative wars on the continent, seeking wealth and fame, as far back as Charlemagne. Scots mercenaries quickly became known in France for their strength and sometimes mad courage, fighting in several key battles of the Hundred Years’ War. Many Scots even of noble blood found service in the French armies. \nA few of the best among the Scots were picked out by Charles VII in 1418 to serve as a special corps, first as frontline troops and later as his royal bodyguard. With our renewed focus on mercenary armies, it is only fair that we give this guard special consideration."
 FEE_France_Events.20.OPT1: "Institutionalize the Scots Guard!"
 FEE_France_Events.20.OPT2: "Nonsense! We do not need them."
