 LRI_Tabriz_title:0 "The Battle of Tabriz"

 LRI_Army_Mission_title:0 "Ready the Lur"

 LRI_Persia_Heart_title:0 "Heart of Persia"

 LRI_economics_of_the_state_title: "Economics of the State"
 LRI_economics_of_the_state_desc: "A small nation like ours bears no future if it is not gaining strength. If we are to liberate the Luri people from foreign yoke, we need to increase our economic potential."
 LRI_buildings_title: "Fund Buildings"

 LRI_marketplaces_title: "Luri Marketplace"
 LRI_marketplaces_desc: "There are no major routes which go in the length of the Luri land. This in turn causes our provinces to be of little value to the merchants. With commerce being one of the best sources of income, this cannot stand!"
 LRI_dominate_trade_title: "Dominate Trade"

 LRI_seek_support_title: "Seek Support"
 LRI_seek_support_desc: "A weak nation with weak economy can only fight others with courage of its people.

We shall minimize that negative impact by swaying them onto our side."
 LRI_seek_allies_title: "Seek Allies"
 LRI_seek_allies_desc: "With independence secured, it is time we sought more alliances to accompany us in our further ventures. While other nations may not trust us now, they shall learn what honor it is to have Luristan as their allies."
