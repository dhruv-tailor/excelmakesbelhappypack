 HNS_rival_the_queen_desc: "Lübeck bears the nickname of the Queen of the Hanseatic League. Indeed, it is true that the city has received more than enough attention from all merchants alike. Let us seize that spot from them and become the new hotspot for merchants and traders around."

 HNS_our_roots_title: "Our Roots"
 HNS_our_roots_desc: "At the core of our roots are the trades that we do. The existence of our league is purely for commerce, let us keep it that way."

 HNS_interests_in_the_baltic_desc: "The Baltic 'Eastern Lake' makes up for like a half of our trade routes. We need to wage our decisions carefully,  else our grip over the region might slip out of our hands."
 HNS_mother_of_all_trade_title: "Mother of All Trade"
 HNS_mother_of_all_trade_desc: "Danzig is one of the most important hanseatic cities. Why is that? It's simple. It is the primary hotspot for the Grain trade - Mother of all Trades.

 HNS_peterhof_title: "Grow Peterhof"
 HNS_peterhof_desc: "Peterhof was organized between us and the Novgorodians as a port for Hanseatic trade in the Eastern Baltic and subsequently Russia.

 HNS_dutch_kontor_title: "The Entrepot of Cloth"

 HNS_london_steelyard_title: "Carta Mercatoria"
 HNS_london_steelyard_desc: ""The Kontor model has proved to be both lucrative and sustainable in Peterhof and Bergen.

The question remains, how shall we approach this; naming a price, or perhaps demands under duress...?""
 HNS_antwerpen_title: "Reinforce Antwerpen"
 HNS_antwerpen_desc: "The Hanzekantoor in Antwerp has fallen into disrepair. It's nothing a few ducats can't fix. Let us pour our ducats into this lucrative trade route."
 HNS_trading_empire_title: "Under the Pennant"
 HNS_trading_empire_desc: "White on top, red on the bottom. That are the colors of the Hanseatic pennant. If one sees those colors on a cog, it is no secret that the Hanseatic merchants are there for business. After all, it is in trade that we find solace."

 HNS_combat_the_decline_desc: "The Hansa is in decline. Has been for a while. We have effectively amortized this trend, but the rise of Colonial Empires threatens our business. Unless we follow suit, our golden age is over."

 HNS_fight_for_baltic_dominance_desc: "There is a war going on in the Baltic Sea right now. Though silent, it is bound to burst into an open conflict. It is a conflict of interests between the Kalmar Union and the Hansa. Who will rule the seas? We will."
 HNS_free_the_sound_title: "Free the Sound"
 HNS_free_the_sound_desc: "Enough is enough. Controlling two pieces of land by sea divided should not imply control over the trade that passes between and through them.

 HNS_defeat_the_danish_title: "Hegemony in Scandinavia"
 HNS_defeat_the_danish_desc: "The Danish have been trying to question our economic hegemony for a while. Time to strike a decisive blow and show that there is nothing as 'questioning Hanseatic authority.'"

 HNS_mercenary_core_title: "A Mercenary Core"
 HNS_mercenary_core_desc: "Unsurprisingly, a Confederation of cities needs not rely on conscripts to fight their wars. Why force people to fight our wars when we can simply hire war-hardened mercenaries?"

 HNS_coast_of_ivory_desc: "The coast of ivory is where such commodities as Ivory, Gold and Spices land after their harvested in Africa and the Indies. Let us make sure the goods are beated routed to the right spots."

 HNS_high_seas_navy_desc: "The symbol of the Hansa may be the cog, but cogs is not what we may sail the high seas with. In order to build a robust trade network with in America, our shipping needs protection."
 HNS_newfoundland_title: "Newfoundland Fisheries"
 HNS_newfoundland_desc: "Not much is known about the American continent, but out of the things that we do know is that it is an unexploited land whose trade networks are beginning to grow which will dictate the great powers of future. One part of the continent in general - Newfoundland - has already gained fame for its fishing grounds which threaten our monopoly over the Scandinavian herring. That trade must be controlled by us."
 HNS_america_title: "American Imports"
 HNS_america_desc: "Among the trade routes newly founded by the explorers in Age of Exploration is the trade with the quite mysterious continent of America. While those lands are still shrouded in mystery, the wealth of it is known as far as [Root.Capital.GetName] and beyond."

These times are, of course, over, but it does not mean we cannot at least attempt to restore the great monopoly of old. The most important task of ours is to adapt, and adapt we must to the new routes that have been shaped by the Age of Discovery. The maritime route to India and the East Indies allows for the lucrative Spice Trade, which is far from our control. Having acquired ports in India, it is time we control the East Indies and bring the Spice where it belongs - [Root.Capital.GetName]."
 HNS_india_title: "Indische Kompanie"
 HNS_india_desc: "Who has not heard of India? This famed land is rich in Gold, Gems and Spices. And it is true that while we have the Gold and Gems here, it is not right however that we have control over the Spice Trade. We need to found new Kontors in India and monopolize the subcontinent's trade for our own benefit."
 HNS_eternal_diet_title: "Eternal Diet"
 HNS_eternal_diet_desc: "Hansetage (Hanseatic Days) were meetings held by the representatives of the Hanseatic Leagues' members. Those were usually held in Lubeck, due to its central position, but could also be held in other Hanseatic cities, prime or not. The meetings were called whenever needed. Unfortunately though, the turnout was quite low, which was the leading cause for many issues. Never was there more than half of the cities' representatives on a single meeting, despite the sanctions that were placed on insubordinate cities. Despite that, it is time we reform this institution and make it into a permanent body of our confederation."
 HNS_grow_the_markets_title: "Grow the Markets"

 HNS_hanseatic_cog_title: "The Cog"
 HNS_hanseatic_cog_desc: "Cog is the ship that is the most associated with our League and the trade practiced by us.

 HNS_french_perpetual_peace_title: "French Perpetual Peace"
 HNS_french_perpetual_peace_desc: "The French are a major power to the west, distinguished in that they have very few, if any, reasons to compete with our own foreign interests. A diplomatic mission to hammer out a non-aggression pack would be mutually beneficial for both of us."

 HNS_establish_new_kontors_desc: "With our newly established diplomatic relations with the kings and dukes in France we will construct a brand new network of trade routes that will reach even further than the bustling streets of Londoner Steelhof.

 HNS_old_salt_road_desc: "One of the trade routes that allowed Lubeck, and consequently, the Hansa, to grow as powerful as the history teaches us, was the Old Salt Route, allowing for the maritime republic's trade for salt.

 HSA_grow_the_league_title: "Grow the League"
 HSA_grow_the_league_desc: "The expansion of the Hansa to include more members and even establishing independent trade cities is a reward in its own. It could be more than just that, though."
 HSA_contact_inner_cities_title: "Contact Inner Cities"

 ME_Hansa_Events.6.d: "Time has come to decide our policy in the Baltic Sea. Will we try to take over the control of our strategic cities, or will we continue our current policy of free trade."
 ME_Hansa_Events.6.a: "We must hold absolute control over the Kontors."
 ME_Hansa_Events.6.b: "We cannot afford to displease our contractors."
 
 ME_Hansa_Events.7.t: "Policy in the Nordsee"
 ME_Hansa_Events.7.d: "Should we send our mercenaries and take over key cities? If we do, we will be able to hold much more control over the trade routes, but we might alienate all of our partners in the mean time. Who wants to trade with a warmonger?"
 ME_Hansa_Events.7.a: "Seize the Kontors."
 ME_Hansa_Events.7.b: "By peace is how we make business."
 
 ME_Hansa_Events.8.t: "Decline of the Hansa"
 ME_Hansa_Events.8.d: "Due to the rise of Colonial Empires, the control over the northern trade has been slipping from our hands. Merchants increasingly travel to the New World and various colonies, instead of trading with us. It is one of the causes for our decline, we must stop this as soon as humanly possible."
 ME_Hansa_Events.8.a: "Worrisome."
 
 ME_Hansa_Events.9.t: "Growth of Lothian"
 ME_Hansa_Events.9.d: "Lothian has been growing rapidly since the onset of Colonialism. With time, even the league has taken interest, with the city becoming a Hanseatic Outpost."
 ME_Hansa_Events.9.a: "Invest, Invest, Invest!"
 
 ME_Hansa_Events.10.t: "Direct Control"
 ME_Hansa_Events.10.d: "We have taken over [Root.GetName], one of our key outposts. Thanks to such, we will be able to exert much more control over the various trade links between our cities and such. Furthermore, thanks to our actions, the city will forever be tied with us."
 ME_Hansa_Events.10.a: "Alright."
 
 ME_Hansa_Events.11.t: "[Root.GetName] Secedes from the League"
 ME_Hansa_Events.11.d: "[Root.GetName] has decided to cut ties with its former trade partners, and to seek to forge a future for themselves. What their future will be is left to be decided."
 ME_Hansa_Events.11.a: "Good Riddance!"
 
 ME_Hansa_Events.12.t: "Emergence of a New League"
 ME_Hansa_Events.12.d: "Having cut ties with the Hansa, we may choose whether we want to forge a new league, to rival the Hansa, or simply seek out other ambitions for ourselves."
 ME_Hansa_Events.12.a: "[Root.GetName] shall lead."
 ME_Hansa_Events.12.b: "We don't want any ties with trade leagues anymore."
 
 ME_Hansa_Events.13.t: "[From.GetName] Desires Leadership"
 ME_Hansa_Events.13.d: "[From.GetName] has been growing quite a bit, up to a point they are second to us in power and influence and are bound to outgrow us. Recently, they have made moves to take control over the league. We cannot just let them do this, can we?"
 ME_Hansa_Events.13.a: "You can take the reins."
 ME_Hansa_Events.13.b: "This league is mine!"
 
 ME_Hansa_Events.15.t: "A New Kontor Founded in [From.GetName]"
 ME_Hansa_Events.15.d: "Thanks to our policies, a new Kontor has been founded in [From.GetName]. The local city is now home to a sizeable community of Hanseatic Merchants, regularly visiting the city for business."
 ME_Hansa_Events.15.a: "Excellent."
 
 ME_Hansa_Events.17.t: "[From.GetName] Requests Closer Relations"
 ME_Hansa_Events.17.d: "[From.GetName] has proposed during a Hansetage to form a Confederation. With much applause, we have been invited to take part and to submit our city to the new administration, maintaining autonomy as one of the core cities of the Confederation."
 ME_Hansa_Events.17.a: "A Federation sounds good."
 ME_Hansa_Events.17.b: "We want to remain independent."

 HNS_call_hansetag_desc: "Hansetage (Hanseatic Days) were meetings held by the representatives of the Hanseatic Leagues' members. Those were usually held in Lubeck, due to its central position, but could also be held in other Hanseatic cities, prime or not. The meetings were called whenever needed. Unfortunately though, the turnout was quite low, which was the leading cause for many issues. Never was there more than half of the cities' representatives on a single meeting, despite the sanctions that were placed on insubordinate cities. Despite that, it is time we reform this institution and make it into a permanent body of our confederation."
