 pga_military_campaign_desc: "As soon as the whole company was assembled, standing in a wide circle round [Root.Monarch.GetName], a curios conversation began. The marshals began to murmur slowly: first one joined and then another, until they were all chanting together in a long rising and falling rhytm, now louder on one side of the ring, now dying away there and rising to a great boom on the other side."

 pga_conquest_tuscany_desc: "The sun was already westering as they rode from Mantova, and the light of it was in their eyes, turning all the rolling fields of Tuscany to a golden haze. There was a beaten way, north-westward along the foot-hills of the White Mountains, aid this they followed, up and down in a green country, crossing small swift streams by many fords. Far ahead and to their right the Alps loomed, even darker and taller they grew as the miles went by. The sun went slowly down before them. Evening came behind."

 pga_trading_florence_desc: "The sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was shining brightly. But the light brought little hope to the man from the lagoon. The enemy before them seemed to have grown rather than diminished, and still more were pressing up from the valley through the breach. The sortie upon the canals gained only a brief respite. The assault on the gates was redoubled. In the St Mark's square the host of our horses roared like a sea, swarmed about its feet from end to end. Many were cast down in ruin, but many more replaced them, and Mercenaries sprang up them like apes in the dark forest of the South. Before the Cathedral's door the dead and broken were piled like shingle in a storm; ever higher rose the hideous mounds, and still the enemy came on."

 pga_great_patrons_desc: "Between 1429 and 1433 the Palazzo dei Priori was enlarged, new churches and private chapels were built, while the patronage of the Baglioni family brought artists such as Piero della Francesca, Pinturicchio and Raphael to Perugia, making it an important artistic centre. In those years Perugia became an important centre of the Umbrian Renaissance, which saw its first unequivocally Renaissance work, with the production of the eight panels of the Stories of St. Bernardino, in which Pinturicchio and Piermatteo d'Amelia collaborated, as well as the young Perugino, together with other artists, a group commonly referred to as the "workshop of 1473". Perugino Pietro Vannucci was the author of numerous works in the city, including a cycle of frescoes in the Sala delle Udienze of the Collegio del Cambio."

Duecento, mainly financed by the municipality of Perugia. Before 1300 the presence of several universitates scholarium is attested. The civil jurist Iacopo da Belviso taught there from 1316 to 1324. On 1 August 1318 Pope John XXII gave the University the right to confer degrees in civil and canonical law, and on 18 February 1328 in medicine and the arts. \nOn 19 May 1355 the emperor Charles IV promulgated an edict to strengthen the papal bulls and to raise the University to the rank of imperial, in order to favor the rebirth of the city after the pestilential waves of the years 1348-49. In 1362 the Collegium Gregorianum (later renamed "Sapienza vecchia") was founded by Cardinal Niccolò Capocci, which at the time of its constitution could accommodate up to forty young people. On a visit to the city on 11 October 1371, Gregory XI raised the newly formed faculty of theology to the level of Studium Generale. In 1426 the Collegio di San Girolamo was born on the initiative of Benedetto Guidalotti, bishop of Recanati, and with the approval of Martin V."

 pga_ward_save_desc: "In 1393 in Perugia, there were bloody battles between rival factions: between the popular party known as the Raspanti and the noble party of the Beccherini. The latter were exiled and forced to retreat outside the city walls to their country estates. A group of twenty-five priors set themselves up to govern the city and they asked Michelotti, who was welcomed into the city with all honours, to preside over it. This was the period of the first seigniory, remembered for its brevity but also characterised by a period of important reforms. Biordo, anxious to extend his possessions, confirmed the authority of the Priors and the municipal institutions."

 pga_monti_appennini_desc: "The day waned, and dusk was twined about the boles of the trees. At last they saw, rising dimly before them, a steep dark land: they had come to the feet of the mountains, and to the green roots of tall Alps. Down the hillside the younglings, leaping from its springs high above, ran noisily from step to step to meet them. One the right of the stream there was a long slope, clad with grass, now grey in the twilight. No trees grew there and it was open to the sky; stars were shining already in lakes between shores of cloud."

 pga_city_ancona_desc: "Francesco Sforza also tried to take the city by treachery; his spies were discovered, locked in sacks and thrown into the sea with stones around their necks (1443). Among the Sforza family, the saying 'Ancona gives to drink and not to eat' was born."
 pga_glory_etruria_title: "Glory to Etruria"
 pga_glory_etruria_desc: "It was a deep night. We lay on top of a pile of stone, and could see nothing beyond it. Mist of shadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all round us. The air seemed hot and heavy; and it was full of rustlings, creakings and a murmur like voices passing. Later there was a great rumble of thunder away south, and flashes of lighting far away across the Valley, Every now and then we could see mountain-peaks, miles and miles away, stab out suddenly, black and white, and then vanish. And behind us there were noises like thunder in hills, but different. At times the whole valley echoed."

Reliant on their superb merchants, they control much of the mercantile movements that happen in the Mediterranean sea. Controlling this Mediterranean sea port will put us at the helm of Mediterranean trade and give us the expertise of these excellent merchants."

 pga_baglioni_ruling_desc: "Between the 14th and 15th centuries they fought with the antagonistic Oddi family for control of Perugia and its countryside, conquering the estates of Bettona, Bastia, Collemancio and Torgiano. In 1416 Braccio da Fortebracci appointed Malatesta I feudal lord of Cannara. Pope Martin V then conferred the rank of Lords of Spello, Pope Leo X of Counts of Bettona, which thus became the administrative centre of what was the New State of the Baglioni (comprising the present municipalities of Bettona, Cannara, Collazzone, and the hamlets of Collemancio, Rosciano, Canalicchio, Tor Segnarelli, Sorgnano, Castelbuono, and Torre del Col). During his absence the Count was replaced by a lieutenant general, there were judges and the bargello."
 pga_signoria_perugina_title: "Signoria Perugina"
 pga_signoria_perugina_desc: "After the 1438, the Baglioni family exercised a hidden lordship over Perugia (i.e. not characterised by total control of civic powers): Braccio I Baglioni, taking advantage of his position as captain of the militia of the Holy See, as he was also the nephew of Braccio da Montone, the previous Lord of the City, exerted an influence on Perugia that soon established its supremacy. In those years, the Umbrian town experienced a period of flourishing growth, as the Baglioni family implemented a policy of expansion and embellishment of the city, having new roads and palaces built."
 pga_rinascimento_baglioni_title: "Rinascimento dei Baglioni"
 pga_rinascimento_baglioni_desc: "At that time, the true inspirer and 'guardian' of the politics of the city of Perugia was Lorenzo de' Medici, the needle in the balance of Italian politics. He held in high regard the importance of having that republic sandwiched between the Signoria of Florence and the Church. The seigniory of Guido and Rodolfo Baglioni was therefore inspired by both the Medici and the Pope, entrusting the two with the task of governing the city with equal responsibility."
 pga_rocca_paolina_title: "Rocca Paolina"
 pga_rocca_paolina_desc: "The fortress was divided into three parts: the Palazzo Papale, the Corridore and the Tenaglia facing the countryside. However, the architect was sensitive enough to incorporate into the new brick walls the ancient Etruscan architecture known as Porta Marzia, which still stands along the street of the same name. The construction of the Rocca Paolina entailed the demolition of about three hundred houses (the entire borough of Santa Giuliana), the palaces of the Baglioni family - the family that dominated the city at the time and leader of the revolt - various towers and churches, including the 15th-century Santa Maria dei Servi, considered to be the most beautiful in the city."
 pga_war_campania_title: "War in Campania"
 pga_war_campania_desc: "As they rode forward the day was overcast. Low grey clouds came over the Wold. A mist shrouded the sun. Ever nearer the tree-clad slopes of the Golenali forest loomed, slowly darkling as the sun went west. They saw no sign of any trail to right or left, but here and there they passed single Lombard, fallen in their tracks as they ran, with grey-feathered arrow sticking in back or throat. At last as the afternoon was waning they came to the eaves of the forest, and in an open glade among the first trees they found the place of the great burning: the ashes were still hot and smoking. War is coming."

The last vestiges of the Visconti are no more, the remnants of their armies run shattered in the fields outside the cities seeking for salvation from the horse lord of Mantua."
 pga_clavis_regni_videbatur_title: "Clavis Regni Videbatur"
 pga_clavis_regni_videbatur_desc: "The dark gates were swung open. The horsemen entered, walking in file behind their guide. They found a broad path, paved with hewn stones, now winding upward, now climbing in short flights of well-laid steps. Many houses built of elegant bricks and many dark doors they passed. Beside the way in a stone channel a stream of clear water flowed, sparkling and chattering. At length they came to the crown of the hill. There stood a high platform above a green terrace, at the foot of which a bright spring gushed from a stone carved in the likeness of a horse's head; beneath was a wide basin from which the water spilled and fed the falling stream. Up the green terrace went a stair of stone, high and broad, and on either sMde of the topmost step were stone-hewn seats. There sat other guards, with drawn swords laid upon their knees. Their golden hair was braided on their shoulders; the sun was blazoned upon their green shields, their long corslets were burnished bright, and when they rose taller they seemed than mortal men."
 pga_conquest_of_rome_title: "Conquest of Rome"
 pga_conquest_of_rome_desc: "Founded according to tradition on April 21, 753 BC (although recent excavations in Lapis niger would date the foundation back to 2 centuries earlier), during its three millennia of history it was the first metropolis of humanity, the beating heart of one of the most important ancient civilizations, which influenced society, the culture, language, literature, art, architecture, philosophy, religion, law and customs of the following centuries. Place of origin of the Latin language, it was the capital of the Roman Empire which extended its dominion over the whole Mediterranean basin and most of Europe, the Papal States, subjected to the temporal power of the popes and the future Kingdom of Italy. By definition, Rome, Caput Mundi and Eternal City are defined. Its historic center, delimited by the perimeter of the Aurelian walls, overlapping of testimonies of almost three millennia, is an expression of the historical, artistic and cultural heritage of the western European world."

 pga_papal_state_title: "The Papal State"
 pga_papal_state_desc: "On several occasions Perugia was a refuge for the popes from the turmoil in Rome, and was the seat of no less than five conclaves, including those that led to the election of Honorius III (1216), Clement IV (1285), Celestine V (1294) and Clement V (1305); the papal presence was characterised by a pacifying role in internal rivalries. However, Perugia never accepted the sovereignty of the papacy: it exercised direct jurisdiction even over members of the clergy and in 1282 was excommunicated for having led an offensive against the Ghibellines against a papal veto. On the other hand, Perugia remained constantly loyal to the Guelph side in the war between the Guelphs and Ghibellines."
 pga_ercolano_perugia_title: "Ercolano di Perugia"
 pga_ercolano_perugia_desc: "According to the account of St Gregory the Great in the Dialogues, Herculaneum died a martyr's death trying to prevent Totila, king of the Ostrogoths, from invading the city. Before the city was taken, Herculaneum tried to save it with an old stratagem: he used the last sack of grain and the last ox, throwing them outside the walls. In this way he intended to give the Ostrogoths the impression that the Perugians had plenty of food to sustain a long siege. Totila gave in, but an informer inside the city let him know that what he had seen was nothing more than a trick, so the leader retraced his steps by conquering the city and harassing the bishop. Ancient biographies relate him to three other famous Umbrian saints of the time: the bishop Saint Florido, the priest Amanzio of Città di Castello and the bishop Fortunato of Todi. Before being beheaded, Herculaneum was flayed alive. According to Gregory the Great, 40 days after the beheading, the bishop's body was found intact and without the signs of the horrendous torture he had undergone."
 pga_raspanti_title: "Raspanti"
 pga_raspanti_desc: "In the second half of the 13th century in the city of Perugia, together with a notable demographic growth, also favoured by the depopulation of the countryside, there was the affirmation of the merchant bourgeoisie which, organised in craft guilds, managed to prevail in the governing magistracies. The new bourgeois class of the Raspanti excluded from power both the nobility and the proletariat who, in search of help, became partisans of the faction that promised greater protection."

 pga_plains_emilia_desc: "With astonishing speed and skill they checked their steeds, wheeled, and came charging round. Soon the companions found themselves in a ring of horsemen moving  in a running circle, up the hill-slope behind them and down, round and round them, and drawing ever inwards. Without a word or cry, suddenly, the Riders halted. A thicket of spears were pointed towards the strangers; and some of the horsemen had guns in hand, and their fingers were already fitted to the trigger. The one rode forward, a tall man, taller than all the rest; from his helm as a crest a white horsetail flowed."

Upon a stake in the middle was set a Lombard officer's head; upon its shattered helm the white badge could still be seen. Further away, not far from the river, where it came streaming out from the edge of the wood, there was a mound."

On that occasion a document was signed, in the presence of a notary, attesting to the submission of the inhabitants of Isola Polvese to the civitas Perusina. At the beginning of the 12th century, power was divided between the Consuls, a general assembly (the Arengo), and a minor council. The name of the main square changed from Piazza San Lorenzo to Piazza del Comune."

In 1198 the city accepted the protection of Innocent III, whose intention was to form a real state in the territories of the Patrimony of St Peter. In fact, the pope confirmed the previous imperial recognition and strengthened it by giving force of law to the city's consuetudines implemented in the administration of justice."
 pga_guerra_sale_title: "Guerra del Sale"

In the course of the 15th century, the bonds of subjection to the States of the Church were loosened again, thanks also to the establishment of a number of seigniories in the territory, the last of which was that of the Baglioni family."

At Spoleto he ordered a messenger who had brought him a hostile letter to be thrown off a bridge. In Assisi, he threw three men from a tower in the main square. In the convent of the Friars Minor he gave orders to punish eighteen monks who had hostile feelings towards him by beating and crushing their testicles on an anvil. In Viterbo he had a prisoner immersed in a spring of boiling water called Pelacano (...) Braccio believed neither iM Heaven nor in Hell, he was an enemy of the Church and of religion and absolutely unworthy of receiving religious obsequies."

The currency par excellence was the Gold Florin, known and appreciated throughout Europe for its intrinsic golden value and the subject of numerous forgeries and imitations by other powers. Obviously, the exchange value of Tuscan coins changed over the centuries. At the time of the Italian unification, the basic currency of the grand duchy was the Tuscan or Florentine lira, equivalent to 84 cents of the Italian lira of the time. One Lira consisted of 20 Tuscan soldi. The mint was in Florence and Pisa. The units of measurement, referring to their medieval origins, in particular the agricultural ones, could vary from city to city, even if the Florentine ones became increasingly common."

High Medieval Northern Italy was further divided by the long running battle for supremacy between the forces of the Papacy and of the Holy Roman Empire. Each city aligned itself with one faction or the other, yet was divided internally between the two warring parties, Guelfs and Ghibellines. The county of Savoy expanded its territory into the peninsula in the late Middle Ages, while Florence developed into a highly organized commercial and financial city-state, becoming for many centuries the European capital of silk, wool, banking and jewelry.

The start of the work dates back to 1297, while in 1326 (the presumed year of the end of construction) Fidanzuola di Bongiovanni and Ambrogio Maitani were responsible for the construction of the retaining wall behind the church and for the completion of the staircase leading to the upper church. In 1381, the commune of Perugia, through the General Council, allowed the church to be officiated by the abbot and the monks of the Body of Christ, while the lower church was entrusted to the fathers of San Domenico in 1400.

Pope John XXII was under French control through the Avignon Papacy and therefore aligned with the French-allied House of Luxembourg against the German King Louis IV. The Pope accordingly threatened heresy charges against the Ghibellines and excommunicated Louis IV in 1324. The Ghibellines then supported Louis' invasion of Italy and coronation as King of Italy and Holy Roman Emperor."
