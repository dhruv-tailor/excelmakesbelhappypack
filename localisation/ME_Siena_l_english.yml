 sie_old_rivalries_title: "Old Rivalries"
 sie_old_rivalries_desc: "The ascendant Florentine Republic is a threat to our survival. Despite their superior numbers we must push them back the same way our forefathers did at the battle of Montaperti many years ago. Another option, of course, would be to be on good terms with them until we are ready to strike."
 sie_siena_papacy_title: "Siena and the Papacy"
 sie_siena_papacy_desc: "Siena has been a Guelph city since the 13th century, perhaps it is time our relations with the Pope be reconsidered?"
 sie_state_church_title: "The State and the Church"
 sie_state_church_desc: "Our government has always emphasised the balance of power between the state and the church. That being said, having a little more influence over the church surely wouldn't hurt..."
 sie_sienese_pope_title: "A Sienese Pope?"
 sie_sienese_pope_desc: "Our proximity to Rome gives us a good chance of gaining influence with the cardinals in the Vatican. If we can convince them to elect our candidate as Pope, we will have a much better chance of influencing other Catholic countries."

 sie_monte_paschi_siena_title: "Monte dei Paschi di Siena"
 sie_monte_paschi_siena_desc: "A charitable foundation that started ot helping pilgrims has evolved into a fledgling financial institution. They have offered to give us a hand with our economy if we approve the statute they have put forward."
 sie_ospedale_santa_maria_scale_title: "Santa Maria delle Scale"
 sie_ospedale_santa_maria_scale_desc: "After the city council took over the hospital and its relics, it has continued to serve as a place to attract and treat pilgrims alike. With our recent battlefield losses, perhaps we can convince a sympathetic clergy to allow our causalties to be treated there as well?"
 sie_sienese_renaissance_title: "Sienese Renaissance"
 sie_sienese_renaissance_desc: "Following in the steps of Duccio's legacy, our artists continue to produce art with more Greek and Byzantine influences. As the only other city to produce art rivalling that of Florence's during the Renaissance, our superior style has come to be known as the Sienese School."

 sie_expand_duomo_title: "Expand the Duomo"
 sie_expand_duomo_desc: "Four score and seven years ago, our fathers halted the expansion of the Santa Maria Assunta due to the Black Death and structural failures. Had it been completed, its size would have rivalled that of St Peter's in Rome, raising suspicions of a papal conspiracy to halt the construction. No matter, completing its expansion would bring glory to Siena, and the Pope can only approve of this contribution to the House of God, whether he likes it or not."
 sie_refurbish_city_centre_title: "Refurbish the City Centre"
 sie_refurbish_city_centre_desc: "With the expansion of the Duomo, there have been calls for similar upgrading works to be done to the city centre. Although the city centre is not too old or in need of repairs, it certainly seems fitting that the centre of government is able to awe locals and foreigners alike."
 sie_palio_siena_title: "Il Palio di Siena"
 sie_palio_siena_desc: "The city folk enjoy bullfighting in the Campo. Considering the cruelty involved and the subsequent clean-up of blood required, it might be a better idea to ban this practice and have them race some animals instead."
 sie_triumph_good_governance_title: "Good Governance"
 sie_triumph_good_governance_desc: "We have surpassed our local rivals in glory and splendour, proving that we are the true heirs of Rome. This must be the result of our good governance, which has ensured the future of the Sienese Republic"

 sie_lupa_senese_title: "La Lupa Sienese"
 sie_lupa_senese_desc: "When Remus killed his brother and took Rome for himself, the twin sons of Romulus, Senius and Aschius fled Rome with the wolf that nourished their father and uncle and bult defenses on three hills in the north to defend against Rome. They ended up giving their names to the cities of Siena and Asciano, and the wolf has become a symbol of our great republic. It is time we made the world aware of our great heritage and that we are the true heirs of Rome!"
 sie_mobilize_contrade_title: "Mobilize the Contrade"
 sie_mobilize_contrade_desc: "The Contrade of Siena were districts set up to provide military troops to the companies hired to protect Siena. With the increasing threats from our neighbours we should mobilize them and draw men for a true Sienese republican army." 
 sie_conquer_pisa_title: "Conquer Pisa"
 sie_conquer_pisa_desc: "Pisa was once a great maritime trading republic and its port is still very strategically valuable, even if the sole purpose of taking it is to deny our rivals from using it."
 sie_defeat_florence_title: "Defeat Florence"
 sie_defeat_florence_desc: "The city of Florence is not just rich but occupies a strategic position on this side of the Appennines. We must ensure that the lands in that area come under our control if we wish to secure our liberty."
 sie_take_lucca_title: "Take Lucca"
 sie_take_lucca_desc: "The inhabitants of Lucca are proud of their independent history. While it is not our intention to force them into submission, they would be much better off under our superior governance. Besides, it's much easier to secure the Tuscany area if we secured the foothills of the Apuan Alps."

 sie_port_siena_title: "Port of Siena"
 sie_port_siena_desc: "Our old ports of Grosseto and Talamone have long been underdeveloped. Even our more recently obtained ports of Porto San Stefano and Porto Ercole on the Monte Argentario have been failures. If we are to secure the Sienese Maremma it is vital that we properly manage them."
 sie_cristallo_colle_val_elsa_title: "Cristallo di Val d'Elsa"
 sie_cristallo_colle_val_elsa_desc: "Despite being contested between Siena and Florence, the crystal city in the Elsa Valley has managed to become an important global center in the manufacturing of glass crystals. Now that the land is firmly under our control and the threat of warfare has ceased, perhaps we can properly expand the glassworks industry in the region?"

 ME_Siena_Events.3.OPT4: "All these animals are too dangerous to be let loose in the Campo. Have good old-fashioned peasants give them piggyback rides instead"
