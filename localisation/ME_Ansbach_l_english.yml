 ans_kingdom_of_ansbach_title: "Hohenzollern State"
 ans_kingdom_of_ansbach_desc: "Our duke holds two thrones and plenty of other titles. We should declare ourselves the State of Ansbach-Brandenburg, the rising power in the Empire! This will give us more popularity in Germany and will improve our diplomatic capabilities while also maintaining good relations with the Emperor. With this action, our subjects in the Markish lands will feel better under our rule."
 ans_hohenzollern_title: "Reinforce the Hohenzollerns"
 ans_hohenzollern_desc: "Our country is ruled by the heir of powerful Hohenzollern state of Brandenburg; we are doomed to be inherited by them. That is, unless we become prestigious and powerful enough to be the senior partner first."
 ans_become_elector_title: "Electorate of Ansbach"
 ans_become_elector_desc: "With Brandenburg as the junior partner, rightfully we may take over their status as an elector! After all, we are the new main Hohenzollern branch, which gives us prestige and legitimacy. All we need is Emperor's favour."
 ans_margraves_palace_title: "Margrave's Palace"
 ans_margraves_palace_desc: "Some of the previous rulers that were the suzerains of Ansbach have expanded the Stiftshof into a water castle, but this simple building will not be enough to glorify the dynasty of Ansbach. It's high time we fund a building to praise the achievements of the Franconian Hohenzollerns."
 ans_duke_of_Franconia_title: "Duke of Franconia"
 ans_duke_of_Franconia_desc: "Several Rulers of Ansbach have tried to revive and claim the old title of 'Duchy of Franconia'. We must make sure that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is the rightful duke of Franconia. There is no better way to accomplish this than to become exalted among men and get the favour of the Emperor."
 ans_Ansbach_porcelain_title: "Ansbach Porcelain"
 ans_Ansbach_porcelain_desc: "Not so long after Johann Friedrich Böttger finally discovered the secret of producing porcelain, many porcelain manufactories sprung up across Europe, the most prominent among them being the Meissner porcelain manufactories. If we appeal to the Saxons, we may be able to exploit this knowledge and create manufactories of our own."
