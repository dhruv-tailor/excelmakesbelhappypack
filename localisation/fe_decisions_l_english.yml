 hokucho_nation_title: "Reform the Northern Court"
 hokucho_nation_desc: "The period of disruption and waning authority stemming from the Ashikaga Shogunate has yielded multiple chances for lowly daimyo to fill in the vacancy of various provinces and areas. Whilst there are daimyo that are only out for themselves, there are some that are seeking to undermine the entire notion of the shogunate and instead want a return to having an emperor be in power. In order to stop these upstart ideas from gaining too much traction, we should reform the Northern Court, Hokucho, and cement our position as a strong shogunate that succeeds where the Ashikaga Clan failed."
 nancho_nation_title: "Legitimacy of the Southern Court"
 nancho_nation_desc: "We cannot abide by the endless military governance of various shogunates that impose military authority over the vast swaths of Japan; the emperor has been disempowered for far too long. Perhaps if we control enough land around the old Southern Court capital of Yoshino in the Yamato province, we can begin building up the legitimacy and power of a new Southern Court. There will be those who oppose us of course, since the Ashikaga Shogunate will have several backers and clans who are eager to succeed it, but we must see to it that the emperor is upheld over the likes of the shogun."
 kenmu_nation_title: "The Legacy of Emperor Go-Daigo"
 kenmu_nation_desc: "The beginning of the Nanbuko-cho Jidai was with the revolt of Emperor Go-Daigo against the old Kamakura Shogunate since his ambition was to return Japan to a civilian form of government instead of another military government. Though his reforms and work ultimately led to the collapse of his 'Kenmu Restoration' period and the ultimate rise of the Ashikaga Shogunate after the fighting between the Southern and Northern Court, there is a legacy to be gleaned from his brief three years holding Kyoto for the Kenmu Restoration. Perhaps we can pick up where he left off, but if we do so, there will be many daimyo who oppose us openly."
 united_japan_kenmu_title: "Japan is United (for Kenmu)"
 united_japan_kenmu_desc: "The warring factions of Japan have finally been united under a strong emperor."
 somali_nation_title: "A Land for Somali People"
 somali_nation_desc: "Centuries have gone by as the Somali people tried to make their way in the world. Trading in coastal cities, swearing fealty to various clans, and trying to maintain themselves despite outside influences from Arabia, East Africa, and all across the Red Sea's coast. Though unification to some clans seems unlikely, we need to have faith in our people and our leaders that they can carve out a place fit for the Somali people; a place where they can prosper without internal clan feuds breaking things down and outside forces taking what they want."
 lombard_league_nation_title: "Evoca la Lega Lombarda"
 lombard_league_nation_desc: "The power of the Holy Roman Empire is waning more and more, but still the successive emperors have tried their hands at keeping the cities of the Italian Peninsula loyal and obedient. Fractured and disunited for a long time now, there has been little in the way of a confederation like the old Lombard League of the 1200s to stop the Holy Roman Empire's influences, but that memory of the league is certainly not lost on us nor the people of Milan, Verona, Ferrara, and many other cities. Perhaps it is time that we summon the Lombard League once more?"
 fujiwara_nation_title: "The Grandeur of the Fujiwara Clan"
 fujiwara_nation_desc: "Originating from Nakatomi no Kamatari (614-669), he was rewarded by Emperor Tenji with the grand name, 'Fujiwara'. This name became a surname for the descendants of Kamatari and his clan, the Fujiwara Clan, became one of the most powerful clans in all of Japan during the Heian Period. Much has happened since the time of our apex in the 900s to the 1100s, but we are not without our descendants and scattered power. Perhaps if the branches of the old Fujiwara Clan are united together, they can reform the likes of the old clan and bring harmony back to the cities of Japan."
 taira_nation_title: "The Honor of the Taira Clan"
 taira_nation_desc: "Commonly refered to as 'Heishi' or 'Heiki', the Taira Clan was one of the four great clans that ruled over Japanese politics during the Heian Period. All four held Japan in their hands but they always strived to control all of it somehow through military means or political moves. The Taira Clan came close after dethroning the Fujiwara Clan from power in the Hogen Rebellion and the Heiji Rebellion, but all was lost in the treacherous Genpei War that saw the Minamoto Clan rise to prominence. The descendants of the Taira Clan are still struggling for power against other daimyo, and it is our duty to unite them together and retake what is rightfully ours."
 minamoto_nation_title: "The Strength of the Minamoto Clan"
 minamoto_nation_desc: "We have a grand legacy in our blood, do we not? Being descendants of the Minamoto Clan, the one to found the great Kamakura Shogunate, there is a lot to be expected of us as the various daimyo fight amongst themselves for land and power. Those scattered children of the Minamoto Clan are weak as it is, unfortunately, for they know no central administration beyond their own small dynastic branch and often refuse to listen to whoever is the current shogun. If we can retake the old domains of the Minamoto Clan and reform the clan into something more centralized than before, we will be ready to take power across Japan."
 lombardy_venetia_nation_title: "Lombardi e Veneziani, unitevi!"
 lombardy_venetia_nation_desc: "The northern lands of the Italian Peninsula have been plagued by influence from the Holy Roman Empire to the north and the Papal States to the south. The various republics and duchies that are seeking to find a path through the harrowing times need strong and righteous leadership that stems from inside the Italian Peninsula, not outside of it. The various people of the north though... They do not seem to be capable of carving out a state strong enough to claim this position; it seems to only be the Lombards and Venetians who are able to. If they can set aside their differences and come together somehow, perhaps a brighter and more unified future is possible."
 huaxyacac_nation_title: "Zapotec, Mixtec, and Tlapanec People"
 huaxyacac_nation_desc: "The Aztecs of Tenochtitlan have taught surrounding people groups that warfare is just as common now as it was ages ago, and our people and their related kin groups have been at war with each other for what seems like an eternity. Whether they are Aztecs invading our land or Mayan people raiding our villages and towns, the Zapotec, Mixtec, and Tlapanec people have known little in the way of peace. But, perhaps there is hope at the end of this tunnel laden with blood and tears. If we can unite the various kin groups under one singular authority and reform the administration, we might just be able to see a new light."
