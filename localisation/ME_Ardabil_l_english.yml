 ARL_Gilan_title: "Connections in Gilan"
 ARL_Gilan_desc: "The Safavid affiliation to the Gilani dates back many years. We must look after our relationship for generations to come, as no weak nation succeeds alone.

 ARL_Revenge_on_Shirvanshah_title: "Revenge on Shirvanshah"
 ARL_Revenge_on_Shirvanshah_desc: "The Shahs of Shirvan are the root cause of the turmoil following the death of Ismail's ancestor. The father of our Grandmaster has been murdered by the Shirvanshah himself. We cannot tolerate such an insult. It is time for the Sheikh to avenge his father."
 ARL_Partition_Biapas_title: "Partition Biapas"
 ARL_Partition_Biapas_desc: "The Sunnite state of Biapas lies between us and our faithful allies in Gilan. With the Ardabili claims to their Astaran possessions and the recently seized territory of Fuman, stolen from Gilan, their offenses must be brought to the justice of Allah."

 ARL_Into_Persia_title: "Defeat Ajam"
 ARL_Into_Persia_desc: "We lay claim to the northern territories of Azerbaijan, which are currently controlled by the prince Muhammad Baysonqor of the Timurid dynasty.

 ARL_Flow_from_hormuz_title: "Control of the Strait"
 ARL_Flow_from_hormuz_desc: "While the control of the goods that are unloaded in the mouth of Euphrates is important, it will not bring us any good if all products are not going through the straits of Hormuz. To truly benefit from our control of Mesopotamia, we must exert our influence of the Hormuzi Merchants and to force them to comply with our demands."
 ARL_Graveyard_title: "The Eastern Frontier"
 ARL_Graveyard_desc: "On our eastern frontier lies the ancient lands of the Parthians and the graveyard of the Empires – the formidable Afghanistan upon which many have lost their lives trying to conquer. We must secure these areas if we are to restore the glory of Persia."
 ARL_Pacify_the_armenians_title: "Pacify the Armenians"

 ARL_Shia_Propaganda_title: "Shia Propaganda"
 ARL_Shia_Propaganda_desc: "With our boundaries reaching the Ottoman Empire, our relentless push west is halted by a Sunnite power that is trying to prevent our recruitment of Turkic tribes.

 ARL_adopt_persian_administration_title: "Adopt Persian Administration"
 ARL_adopt_persian_administration_desc: "Our administration, in its current state, does not properly emulate Persian governance.

 ARL_the_third_force_title: "The Third Force"
 ARL_the_third_force_desc: "As Georgian influence grows within Ardabil, they have come to be known as the ‘Third Force,’ likely referring to their role between the two major ends of our politics, serving as a check to both.

 ARL_Qurchi_guard_title: "The Qurchi Guard"

To combat this, we must create the elite Gholams–Christian slaves that have been converted to Shia and soon will form the elite infantry of the Safavid Empire."
 ARL_Shia_state_religion_title: "Establish the State Religion"

 ARL_invite_shia_scholars_title: "Invite Shia Scholars"
 ARL_invite_shia_scholars_desc: "To aid the conversion of the state, we need a skilled priesthood that will help fill the lack of clergy in the mosques. And while we can't find enough clergymen in our territories, there is a seemingly endless supply of persecuted Shia Scholars abroad who would gladly take refuge in our state."
 ARL_conversion_of_mosques_title: "Conversion of Mosques"
 ARL_conversion_of_mosques_desc: "If we are to convert Persia to Shia, we need to halt the Sunni prayers and shatter their unity that they possess in their mosques. The fate of Sunni mosques is clear–they will either be converted to Shia or be destroyed."
 ARL_Conversion_of_iran_title: "Convert Iran to the Twelver"
 ARL_Conversion_of_iran_desc: "To preserve stability in our state, we must convert the heretics who choose the foolish path of disbelief in the Twelve Imams.

 #Events:

 ME_Ardabil_Events.1.d: "The Safavids have long held with the monarchs of Shirvan, ever since the Safaviyya Order made contacts with the Shirvanshah. The product of this conflict is the death of [Root.Monarch.GetName], our beloved Sheikh who perished as a result of a battle against the Shirvanshah. We do not have to worry, as there is a skilled, albeit young successor to take his place."
 ME_Ardabil_Events.1.a: "The Succession is Safe."

 ME_Ardabil_Events.2.t: "Tabriz Captured"
 ME_Ardabil_Events.2.d: "On this blessed day we have taken over the capital city of our former enemies and its surroundings. The Qara Qoyunlu have been a threat to us for far too long, but with the recent victory of ours, we have become the new hegemon of the area. With the formal acquisition of the great city of Tabriz, it is time for the Sheikh [Root.Monarch.GetName] to crown himself as the rightful Shah in Tabriz."
 ME_Ardabil_Events.2.a: "Wonderful News!"

 ME_Ardabil_Events.3.t: "To Please the Qizilbashi"
 ME_Ardabil_Events.3.d: "The Qizilbashi are truly the backbone of our army and without their loyalty, we would not be able to wage war on such a large scale. If we are to conquer Persia, there is only one choice: to cede the Tabriz countryside to the Qizilbashi."
 ME_Ardabil_Events.3.a: "A Novel Idea!"
 ME_Ardabil_Events.3.b: "We can't afford to rely on them."

 ME_Ardabil_Events.4.t: "Our Allies in Gilan"
 ME_Ardabil_Events.4.d: "We have been in a alliance with the rulers of Gilan for a decades and our states are in a long-standing friendship. Before the ascension of Ismail to the Safavid Throne he took refuge in Gilan and was raised there. The lasting alliance ought not to be broken, yet it must evolve. It is the time for the Shah of Gilan to become an [Root.GetAdjective] vassal."
 ME_Ardabil_Events.4.a: "Sure, the relationship should evolve."
 ME_Ardabil_Events.4.b: "Keep it the way it is."

 ME_Ardabil_Events.5.t: "The Rising Safavid Order"
 ME_Ardabil_Events.5.d: "We cradled the Safavid ruler before he created his mighty state and now he has the gall to request our vassalage. If we are to deny his request, the alliance will be formally kept but time will tell if the Safavid successors will see us as a worthy ally or not."
 ME_Ardabil_Events.5.a: "Let us submit and hope their rule is benevolent."
 ME_Ardabil_Events.5.b: "The audacity!"

 ME_Ardabil_Events.6.t: "The Third Estate"
 ME_Ardabil_Events.6.d: "The Georgian people inside our country have been very influential since the humble origins of our state. Now, with Georgia conquered, we are in control of their homeland and we can please the Georgian estate by giving special autonomy and protection to the Georgian lands."
 ME_Ardabil_Events.6.a: "Georgians should have high autonomy!"
 ME_Ardabil_Events.6.b: "All this land is mine and that triagonal sign! ! They're mine, mine, mine, mine, mine!"

 ME_Ardabil_Events.7.t: "Sunni Sites in Baghdad"
 ME_Ardabil_Events.7.d: "Baghdad is the home to several holy Sunni sites such as the tombs of Abu Hanifa, grave of Abdul-Qadir Gilani and many other Sunni Saints. Our soldiers, upon entering the city, started desecrating such sites but were stopped by one of the lesser commanders of our army. Destroying the holy sites of Sunni will show the Muslim world the power of our Shia state and cripple the faith of the Sunnis. While the destruction of the sites would bring us many benefits, it might be better to keep them intact to quell the Sunni unrest."
 ME_Ardabil_Events.7.a: "Desecrate them!"
 ME_Ardabil_Events.7.b: "We should not go too far."

 ARL_Tooltip.8: "The '§YThird Force§!' mission will have different requirements and will be able to be taken §Y50 years§! earlier as long as §Y[GEO.GetName]§! remains as a subject to @[Root.GetTag] §Y[Root.GetName]§!."
