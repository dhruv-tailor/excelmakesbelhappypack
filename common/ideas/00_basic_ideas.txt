# Do not change tags in here without changing every other reference to them.
# If adding new groups or ideas, make sure they are unique.

# ai_will do is only used to determine which idea group is picked if AI_USES_HISTORICAL_IDEA_GROUPS define is 0, OR start is custom/random
# ai never picks an idea that resolves to ai_will_do = 0, even if AI_USES_HISTORICAL_IDEA_GROUPS = 1
# ROOT = country picking the idea
# groups set to colonial=yes will be higher prioritized by the AI when spending power
